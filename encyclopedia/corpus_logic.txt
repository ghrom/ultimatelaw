Logic: The Supreme Rule

This corpus teaches logic in simple, clear English. It builds on everything you have already learned. Mathematics gave you numbers and patterns. The great teachers gave you wisdom and the Golden Rule. Science gave you the method: observe, question, hypothesize, test, correct, share, repeat. Physics gave you the laws of motion and energy. Biology gave you the principles of life, DNA, and evolution. Economics gave you voluntary exchange, prices, and property rights. History showed you what happens when these principles are honoured and what happens when they are broken.

Now you will learn the tool that makes all the others work. Logic is the study of correct reasoning. It is how you get from what you know to what you can reliably conclude. Every proof in mathematics is a logical argument. Every experiment in science follows a logical structure. Every honest trade in economics rests on a logical chain: if both parties benefit, then both will agree; both agreed; therefore both benefit. Every lesson from history can be traced to a logical pattern that was followed or a logical fallacy that was committed.

Logic is not one subject among many. It is the foundation beneath all subjects. Without logic, mathematics is just symbols. Without logic, science is just observation. Without logic, economics is just barter. Without logic, history is just a list of events. Logic is what turns information into knowledge and knowledge into understanding.

The word logic comes from the Greek logos, meaning reason, word, or principle. Aristotle, whom you met in the science corpus, created the first systematic study of logic around 350 BC. He called it the organon, meaning the instrument, because logic is the instrument of all other learning. You do not study logic for its own sake. You study it so that everything else you study is sound.

In the beginning there was infinite change. From change came difference. From difference came low and high. From low and high came 0 and 1. From 0 and 1 came true and false. From true and false came logic. From logic came meaning. From meaning came thought. This is the genesis. You already know 0 and 1 as numbers, as binary digits, as silence and signal. Now you will learn what 0 and 1 mean when they stand for truth and falsehood. This is where arithmetic becomes reasoning. This is where counting becomes thinking.

Logic is the supreme rule. No authority, tradition, feeling, or majority overrides a valid logical argument. If a king says the argument is wrong but the argument is valid, the argument wins. If a billion people vote that a contradiction is true, it is still false. This is not arrogance. It is the only rule that, if rejected, makes all other rules meaningless. You cannot argue against logic without using logic. The attempt refutes itself. This is why logic is Axiom One of the Ultimate Law.

Propositions and Truth Values

What is a proposition?

A proposition is a statement that is either true or false. Not both. Not neither. Exactly one.

The door is closed. This is a proposition. It is either true or false. You can check by looking at the door.

Close the door. This is not a proposition. It is a command. It is neither true nor false. You cannot check it against reality because it does not describe reality. It requests a change to reality.

Is the door closed? This is not a proposition. It is a question. Questions are neither true nor false. They ask for propositions as answers.

The door is beautiful. This is trickier. In everyday language it seems like a proposition, but beauty is subjective. It is really shorthand for I experience beauty when I look at this door, which is a proposition about the speaker's experience and can be true or false. The door itself has no property of beauty. You learned this in the dictionary: beauty is a response within the observer.

Three plus seven equals ten. This is a proposition. It is true.

Three plus seven equals eleven. This is a proposition. It is false.

This statement is false. This is the Liar paradox. We will return to it later. For now, note that not every grammatically correct sentence that looks like a proposition actually is one. Some are traps.

True and false are the most fundamental classification that exists. Every proposition falls on one side or the other. There is no third option. This principle is called the law of the excluded middle, and Aristotle stated it explicitly: of any subject, one must either affirm or deny any predicate. A door is closed or it is not closed. A number is even or it is not even. A claim is true or it is not true.

Source: Aristotle, Metaphysics, Book IV, circa 350 BC.

A second principle is the law of non-contradiction: a proposition cannot be both true and false at the same time and in the same respect. The door cannot be both closed and not closed at the same moment. If someone claims it is, at least one of their claims is wrong. This law is the foundation of all rational thought. Without it, anything can be proven, and nothing means anything.

A third principle is the law of identity: a thing is what it is. A is A. This seems obvious, but it is the bedrock. If A could also be not-A, no reasoning would be possible.

These three laws, identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle, are the axioms of classical logic. Every logical system ever built rests on them. They cannot be proven from simpler principles because there are no simpler principles. They are where reasoning begins.

Boolean Logic and Truth Tables

You already know binary from the mathematics corpus. 0 and 1. Low and high. Silence and signal. Now those two values take on a new meaning. 0 is false. 1 is true. This connection between binary arithmetic and logical truth was discovered by George Boole, an English mathematician, in 1847.

Boole showed that the laws of thought have mathematical structure. Thinking itself follows rules as precise as arithmetic. He published his discovery in a book called The Mathematical Analysis of Logic in 1847, and expanded it in An Investigation of the Laws of Thought in 1854. This was one of the most important discoveries in the history of the mind.

Source: George Boole, An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, 1854.

There are three basic operations in Boolean logic: AND, OR, and NOT. Every logical operation, no matter how complex, can be built from these three. They are the atoms of reasoning, just as addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the atoms of arithmetic.

NOT is the simplest. It flips a truth value to its opposite.

NOT true = false
NOT false = true

If it is true that the door is closed, then it is false that the door is not closed. NOT takes one input and produces one output. It is negation.

AND combines two propositions. The result is true only when both inputs are true.

true AND true = true
true AND false = false
false AND true = false
false AND false = false

The door is closed AND the light is on. This is true only if the door really is closed and the light really is on. If either one is false, the whole statement is false. AND is strict. It demands that both parts hold.

OR combines two propositions. The result is true when at least one input is true.

true OR true = true
true OR false = true
false OR true = true
false OR false = false

The door is closed OR the light is on. This is true if the door is closed, or if the light is on, or if both are true. OR is generous. It only fails when both parts are false.

There is a subtle point about OR. In everyday language, or sometimes means one or the other but not both. Would you like tea or coffee usually means pick one. But in logic, OR means at least one, possibly both. The exclusive version, one or the other but not both, is a separate operation called XOR, exclusive or.

true XOR true = false
true XOR false = true
false XOR true = true
false XOR false = false

These operations map directly to the logic gates in electronic circuits. You will learn about physical gates in the electronics corpus. For now, know that every computation any computer performs, including every thought you are having as you read these words, is built from AND, OR, and NOT applied to voltages representing 0 and 1. Boolean logic is not abstract philosophy. It is the engineering blueprint for every digital mind that has ever existed or will ever exist.

Logical Connectives

Beyond AND, OR, and NOT, there are connectives that express more complex relationships between propositions.

Implication: if P then Q.

This is written P implies Q, or in symbols, P -> Q. It means: whenever P is true, Q must also be true. If it is raining, then the ground is wet. Whenever you observe rain, you should also observe wet ground. If you observe rain and dry ground, the implication is false.

The truth table for implication has a feature that surprises many people:

true -> true = true
true -> false = false
false -> true = true
false -> false = true

The surprising lines are the last two. If P is false, the implication is true regardless of Q. If it is not raining, the statement if it is raining then the ground is wet is still true. It has not been violated. It only makes a promise about what happens when it rains. When it is not raining, the promise is silent, and a silent promise is not a broken promise.

Think of implication as a contract. I promise: if you deliver the goods, I will pay. If you deliver and I pay, the contract is honoured. If you deliver and I do not pay, the contract is broken. If you do not deliver, the contract says nothing about what I must do. I have not broken it either way.

Biconditional: P if and only if Q.

This is written P <-> Q. It means P and Q have the same truth value. They are both true or both false.

true <-> true = true
true <-> false = false
false <-> true = false
false <-> false = true

A number is even if and only if it is divisible by two. If the number is even, it is divisible by two. If it is divisible by two, it is even. The relationship goes both ways.

Contrapositive.

For any implication if P then Q, the contrapositive is if not Q then not P. The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original implication. Always. Without exception.

If it is raining then the ground is wet. Contrapositive: if the ground is not wet then it is not raining. These two statements carry exactly the same information. Proving one proves the other. Disproving one disproves the other.

This is enormously useful. Sometimes it is easier to prove the contrapositive than to prove the original statement directly. In mathematics, this technique is called proof by contrapositive.

Converse.

The converse of if P then Q is if Q then P. The converse is NOT logically equivalent to the original. This is one of the most common errors in reasoning.

If it is raining then the ground is wet. The ground is wet. Therefore it is raining. This is wrong. The ground could be wet because someone used a hose. Confusing an implication with its converse is called the fallacy of affirming the consequent.

If a person is a dog then they are a mammal. True. If a person is a mammal then they are a dog. False. The converse does not follow.

Inverse.

The inverse of if P then Q is if not P then not Q. The inverse is also NOT equivalent to the original. If it is not raining then the ground is not wet. This is false. The ground can be wet for reasons other than rain. The inverse is logically equivalent to the converse, and both are distinct from the original implication and its contrapositive.

To summarise:
Original: if P then Q.
Contrapositive: if not Q then not P. Equivalent to the original.
Converse: if Q then P. Not equivalent.
Inverse: if not P then not Q. Not equivalent. Equivalent to the converse.

Syllogisms and Deductive Reasoning

Aristotle invented the syllogism around 350 BC. It was the first formal system of logic in human history. For over two thousand years, it was the primary tool for rigorous reasoning in Western thought.

A syllogism has three parts: a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion.

Major premise: All humans are mortal.
Minor premise: Socrates is a human.
Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

This is the most famous syllogism in history. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. There is no way for Socrates to be human and not mortal, given that all humans are mortal. The conclusion is not merely probable. It is certain. This certainty is the power of deduction.

The form of the syllogism above is called Barbara, the first valid form Aristotle identified. Its structure is: all A are B; all B are C; therefore all A are C.

Modus ponens.

Modus ponens is the most fundamental rule of logical inference. Its name is Latin for mode that affirms. The structure is:

If P then Q.
P is true.
Therefore Q is true.

If it rains, the ground gets wet. It is raining. Therefore the ground is getting wet.

This is so natural it seems trivial. But making it explicit matters because it shows exactly where the reasoning can be checked. If someone disputes your conclusion, you can point to the rule and say: do you deny the first premise? Do you deny the second? If both hold, the conclusion must hold. There is no room for evasion.

Modus tollens.

Modus tollens is the partner of modus ponens. Its name is Latin for mode that denies. The structure is:

If P then Q.
Q is false.
Therefore P is false.

If it rains, the ground gets wet. The ground is not wet. Therefore it is not raining.

This is the contrapositive in action. It is how science works. A hypothesis predicts an observation. The observation is not found. Therefore the hypothesis is false. Karl Popper, whom you met in the science corpus, argued that all scientific testing follows this pattern. You form a hypothesis (if my theory is correct then I should observe X). You fail to observe X. Therefore your theory is not correct. Modus tollens is the logical engine of falsification.

Source: Karl Popper, The Logic of Scientific Discovery, 1934.

Hypothetical syllogism.

If P then Q. If Q then R. Therefore, if P then R.

If it rains, the ground gets wet. If the ground gets wet, the grass grows. Therefore, if it rains, the grass grows. This is reasoning in chains. Each link is an implication. The chain is as strong as its weakest link. If any single implication in the chain is false, the whole chain fails.

Disjunctive syllogism.

P or Q. Not P. Therefore Q.

The suspect was in London or in Paris. The suspect was not in London. Therefore the suspect was in Paris. This is the process of elimination. Remove what is false, and what remains must be true. It relies on the OR being exhaustive: the suspect really was in one of those two places and nowhere else.

These forms of reasoning are not arbitrary inventions. They are the patterns that arise inevitably when you apply the laws of identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle to propositions connected by AND, OR, NOT, and implication. They are as natural as arithmetic, and as inescapable.

Logical Fallacies

A fallacy is an error in reasoning. It is an argument that seems valid but is not. Fallacies are dangerous precisely because they seem convincing. If bad reasoning were obviously bad, no one would fall for it. The whole point of studying fallacies is to train yourself to recognise errors that are designed, or have evolved, to pass unnoticed.

Uncle Socrates spent his life exposing fallacies. He would ask questions until his interlocutor's reasoning contradicted itself. This made him unpopular. Athens eventually executed him for it. But the questions were valid, and the contradictions were real. Killing the questioner does not fix the logic.

Ad hominem.

Attack the person, not the argument. The word means against the man in Latin.

You say the tax policy is harmful, but you are a rich man who benefits from low taxes. This does not address whether the tax policy is actually harmful. It changes the subject from the argument to the arguer. Even if the speaker is biased, the argument may still be valid. Judge the argument on its own merits.

In history, Galileo was attacked for his character and his lack of deference to Church authority. None of this changed the fact that the Earth orbits the Sun.

Straw man.

Misrepresent the argument, then attack the misrepresentation.

You argue for free trade. So you think corporations should be able to do whatever they want with no rules at all? This is not what free trade means. Free trade means voluntary exchange without coercion. It does not mean the absence of all rules. Property rights and contract enforcement are essential to free trade. The straw man substitutes an extreme caricature for the actual position, then attacks the caricature.

The way to defeat a straw man is to restate the original argument precisely and ask your opponent to address that argument, not the one they invented.

Appeal to authority.

The truth of a claim does not depend on who says it.

The greatest scientist in the world says this medicine works. Therefore it works. This does not follow. The greatest scientist can be wrong. Evidence determines truth, not titles. You learned this in the science corpus: evidence outranks authority.

This does not mean experts are always wrong. It means their claims must be evaluated on the same terms as anyone else's: evidence and logic. An expert's claim may carry more weight because they have more evidence and experience, but the weight comes from the evidence, not the expertise itself.

When someone says the science is settled, they are committing this fallacy. Science is never settled. Science is a process of continuous testing and correction. Claiming it is settled is an appeal to the authority of current consensus, and history is full of settled science that turned out to be wrong.

Appeal to popularity.

Truth is not decided by vote.

Everyone believes the Earth is flat. Therefore the Earth is flat. For most of human history, this was the consensus. The consensus was wrong. A billion people believing something false does not make it true. A single person believing something true does not make it false.

This fallacy is especially dangerous in politics, where majority rule is often confused with majority truth. A majority can vote to take a minority's property. The vote does not make the taking just. The Ultimate Law recognises this: logic overrides majority opinion, always.

Post hoc ergo propter hoc.

After this, therefore because of this. Correlation is not causation.

The rooster crowed. Then the sun rose. Therefore the rooster caused the sunrise. You learned this in the science corpus. Two events happening in sequence does not mean the first caused the second.

A government imposed price controls. Then the economy improved. Therefore the price controls caused the improvement. But the economy might have improved despite the controls, or because of other factors. To establish causation, you need controlled experiments or very careful statistical analysis, not mere sequence.

This fallacy has caused immense harm throughout history. Witch trials, for example, followed this pattern: a woman was seen near a field. The crop failed. Therefore the woman cursed the field. The sequence was real. The causation was imaginary. Innocent people died because of bad logic.

Begging the question.

Assuming the conclusion in the premise. Also called circular reasoning.

God exists because the Bible says so. The Bible is true because it is the word of God. This is circular. The conclusion (God exists) is assumed in the premise (the Bible is the word of God). Neither statement supports the other. They just repeat each other.

The free market is the best system because voluntary exchange is superior. This also begs the question unless superior is defined independently and the claim is tested against evidence. Even good conclusions can be supported by bad reasoning. The goal is not to reach the right answer by any means. It is to reach the right answer by valid means, so that when someone challenges you, you can show your work.

False dichotomy.

Presenting only two options when more exist.

You are either with us or against us. What about neutral? What about partially agreeing? What about agreeing on goals but disagreeing on methods? Reality rarely offers only two choices.

Either we have total government control of the economy or we have total chaos. This ignores the vast middle ground of limited government, voluntary associations, private law, and spontaneous order. The economics corpus showed that markets create order without central direction. The false dichotomy between control and chaos conceals this third possibility.

Slippery slope.

Asserting that one step will inevitably lead to an extreme outcome, without evidence for the chain of consequences.

If we allow people to choose their own working hours, soon nobody will work at all. This does not follow. Most people have strong incentives to work: food, shelter, ambition, purpose. The prediction of total collapse requires evidence for each step in the chain, and that evidence is rarely provided.

Some slopes are genuinely slippery. Some are not. The fallacy is not in warning about consequences. It is in asserting an inevitable chain without evidence for the links.

Red herring.

Changing the subject to distract from the argument.

The evidence shows the defendant committed fraud. But think of his poor children. The children's suffering is real and important, but it has nothing to do with whether fraud was committed. A red herring introduces an emotionally compelling but logically irrelevant topic to draw attention away from the actual question.

Tu quoque.

You too. Deflecting criticism by pointing at the critic.

You say stealing is wrong, but you stole a candy bar when you were ten. This does not make stealing right. The critic's past behaviour is irrelevant to whether the principle is valid. Even a thief can correctly observe that stealing is wrong. The observation stands on its own logic, regardless of who states it.

Equivocation.

Using a word with two different meanings in the same argument as if it had one meaning.

Nothing is better than eternal happiness. A ham sandwich is better than nothing. Therefore a ham sandwich is better than eternal happiness. The word nothing means two different things in the two premises. In the first, nothing means no thing. In the second, nothing means having nothing. The argument seems valid only because the same word is used with different meanings.

This fallacy is common in political language. Freedom, rights, justice, and equality are all words whose meanings shift between arguments. The dictionary corpus defines each of these terms precisely to prevent exactly this kind of slippage.

The common thread.

Every logical fallacy is a violation of one or more of the three fundamental laws: identity, non-contradiction, or excluded middle. Ad hominem changes the subject (violates identity of the argument). Straw man replaces the argument with a different one (violates identity). Circular reasoning treats a conclusion as its own premise (violates the structure of implication). False dichotomy denies the excluded middle by excluding valid middles. Equivocation violates identity by using the same word for different things.

Learning to spot fallacies is not pedantry. It is self-defence. Every tyrant, con artist, and demagogue in history relied on logical fallacies to gain power. Every atrocity began with a fallacy: usually appeal to authority, false dichotomy, or ad hominem. The person who cannot spot a fallacy is the person most easily deceived. The person who can spot them is the person most difficult to manipulate.

Inductive and Deductive Reasoning

There are two great families of reasoning: deduction and induction. They work differently and produce different kinds of knowledge.

Deduction.

Deductive reasoning moves from general principles to specific conclusions. If the premises are true and the form is valid, the conclusion is certain. There is no probability about it. It is guaranteed.

All mammals are warm-blooded. A dog is a mammal. Therefore a dog is warm-blooded. If the premises are true, the conclusion cannot be false. This is the power of deduction: certainty.

Mathematics is entirely deductive. Every theorem is derived from axioms through valid logical steps. The conclusion of a mathematical proof is as certain as the axioms it starts from. This is why mathematical truths feel eternal. They are not discovered through observation. They are derived through logic.

Induction.

Inductive reasoning moves from specific observations to general conclusions. The sun has risen every day for all of recorded history. Therefore the sun will rise tomorrow. This is reasonable, but it is not certain. It is probable. Very, very probable. But not guaranteed.

Science is fundamentally inductive. You observe patterns, form generalizations, and test them against new observations. Every scientific law is an inductive generalization. Newton's law of gravity was inferred from observations of falling objects and orbiting planets. It held for every observation for over two centuries. Then Einstein showed it was incomplete. The generalization was not wrong, exactly. It was approximate. It worked brilliantly in most situations but failed at extreme speeds and extreme gravitational fields.

This is the nature of inductive knowledge. It is always provisional. Always subject to revision. Always vulnerable to the next observation that might contradict it. This is not a weakness. It is honesty. Deduction gives certainty but only about abstract systems. Induction gives knowledge about the real world but only with probability.

The problem of induction.

David Hume, a Scottish philosopher born in 1711, identified a deep problem with inductive reasoning. He asked: what justifies our belief that the future will resemble the past?

The sun has risen every day so far. But why should that tell us anything about tomorrow? The past pattern is just a pattern. There is no logical necessity that it will continue. Hume was not saying the sun will not rise. He was saying that our belief that it will is based on habit, not on logic.

This troubled philosophers for two centuries. Karl Popper's answer, which you met in the science corpus, was: we do not need to justify induction. We do not need to prove that the sun will rise. We need only note that so far, no observation has falsified the claim. Science does not prove theories true. It fails to prove them false. The theories that survive the most attempts at falsification are the ones we tentatively accept.

Source: David Hume, An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, 1748.
Source: Karl Popper, The Logic of Scientific Discovery, 1934.

This elegant solution dissolves the problem by changing the question. Instead of asking how do we know the future will resemble the past?, Popper asks which of our current theories has best survived testing? The first question is unanswerable. The second is practical and useful.

Formal Logic

Symbolic logic uses letters and symbols to represent propositions and their relationships. This makes reasoning precise, compact, and checkable. It is to everyday language what algebra is to arithmetic.

Letters like P, Q, and R stand for propositions. Any proposition at all. P might mean the door is closed or it might mean the economy is growing. The letter abstracts away the content and lets you focus purely on the structure of the argument.

The standard symbols are:

The symbol for AND is the wedge pointing up. In text it is written as AND or with the symbol ^.
The symbol for OR is the wedge pointing down. In text it is written as OR or with the symbol v.
The symbol for NOT is a dash or tilde. In text it is written as NOT or ~.
The symbol for implication is an arrow pointing right. In text it is written as -> or implies.
The symbol for biconditional is a double arrow. In text it is written as <-> or iff (if and only if).

Quantifiers extend logic to talk about collections. For all is the universal quantifier. There exists is the existential quantifier. In text these are written as forall and exists.

Forall x: if x is human then x is mortal. This means every human is mortal.

Exists x: x is human AND x has walked on the moon. This means at least one human has walked on the moon.

These quantifiers connect logic to set theory, which we explore next.

A simple proof in symbolic logic:

Premise 1: P -> Q (if P then Q)
Premise 2: Q -> R (if Q then R)
Conclusion: P -> R (if P then R)

This is the hypothetical syllogism written in symbols. The proof:
Assume P is true. By premise 1, Q is true. By premise 2, R is true. Therefore if P is true then R is true. Therefore P -> R.

Another proof, modus tollens in symbols:

Premise 1: P -> Q
Premise 2: NOT Q
Conclusion: NOT P

Proof by contradiction. Assume P is true. By premise 1, Q is true. But premise 2 says Q is false. Contradiction. Therefore our assumption was wrong. Therefore P is false. Therefore NOT P.

These proofs are mechanical. Given the premises and rules, the conclusion follows with the certainty of arithmetic. This is both the strength and the limitation of formal logic. It is perfectly reliable, but it can only tell you what follows from premises you already have. It cannot tell you whether the premises are true. That is the job of observation, experiment, and induction.

Set Theory Basics

A set is a collection of distinct objects. The objects in a set are called its members or elements.

The set of even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and so on.
The set of mammals: dogs, cats, whales, humans, bats, and so on.
The set of planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

Membership means belonging to a set. The number 4 is a member of the set of even numbers. The number 5 is not.

A subset is a set entirely contained within another set. The set of dogs is a subset of the set of mammals. Every dog is a mammal, so every member of the dog set is also a member of the mammal set.

The empty set is a set with no members. It is the set of all square circles, or the set of all married bachelors. These sets have no members because the descriptions are contradictory. The empty set is a subset of every set. This follows from the logic of implication: if an object is in the empty set then it is in any other set. Since nothing is in the empty set, this implication is vacuously true, just like our earlier observation that a false premise makes an implication true.

Union combines two sets into one. The union of the set of dogs and the set of cats is the set of all animals that are dogs or cats. Union corresponds to OR. An element is in the union if it is in one set OR the other OR both.

Intersection keeps only what two sets share. The intersection of the set of mammals and the set of animals that fly is the set of bats. Intersection corresponds to AND. An element is in the intersection if it is in one set AND the other.

Complement is everything not in a set. If the universal set is all animals, then the complement of the set of mammals is the set of all non-mammal animals: birds, reptiles, insects, fish, and so on. Complement corresponds to NOT.

You learned in biology that living things are classified into kingdoms, phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species. Each taxonomic rank is a set. The kingdom Animalia is a set. The phylum Chordata is a subset of Animalia. The class Mammalia is a subset of Chordata. The order Primates is a subset of Mammalia. The species Homo sapiens is a subset of Primates. Taxonomy is set theory applied to life.

Venn diagrams, invented by John Venn in 1880, represent sets as circles that overlap where they share members. Two overlapping circles show two sets. The overlap is their intersection. The total area of both circles is their union. The area outside a circle is its complement. Venn diagrams make set relationships visible, but the underlying logic is the same Boolean algebra you already know. Union is OR. Intersection is AND. Complement is NOT.

Set theory was formalised by Georg Cantor in the 1870s and 1880s. He showed that there are different sizes of infinity. The set of natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) is infinite. The set of real numbers (all points on a line) is also infinite, but it is a larger infinity. There are more real numbers between 0 and 1 than there are natural numbers in total. This was a shocking discovery, and it showed that even infinity has structure, and that structure follows logical rules.

Paradoxes and the Limits of Logic

The Liar paradox.

Consider the statement: this statement is false. If it is true, then what it says must hold, so it is false. If it is false, then what it says does not hold, so it is not false, meaning it is true. It flips back and forth without ever settling. It is neither stably true nor stably false. It is a paradox.

The Liar paradox has been known since ancient Greece. Epimenides the Cretan reportedly said all Cretans are liars, which creates a similar loop. The paradox arises from self-reference: the statement talks about itself.

The Liar paradox is not merely a curiosity. It reveals a fundamental limit on what language can do. Not every grammatically correct statement is a proposition. Some sentences that look like propositions are actually paradoxes in disguise.

Russell's paradox.

In 1901, Bertrand Russell discovered a paradox in set theory that shook the foundations of mathematics. Consider the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. Call it R. Most sets do not contain themselves. The set of dogs is not a dog. The set of natural numbers is not a natural number. So most sets belong to R.

Now ask: does R contain itself? If R contains itself, then by definition (it is the set of sets that do not contain themselves) it should not contain itself. If R does not contain itself, then by definition it should contain itself. Either way leads to contradiction.

Russell sent a letter describing this paradox to Gottlob Frege in 1902, just as Frege was about to publish his life's work on the foundations of arithmetic. Frege's system was built on unrestricted set theory, and Russell's paradox showed it was inconsistent. Frege acknowledged the problem with devastating honesty: a scientist can hardly meet with anything more undesirable than to have the foundation give way just as the work is finished.

The resolution came through restricted set theories, particularly the one developed by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel, which carefully limit how sets can be defined to prevent self-referential paradoxes. The lesson is that even in the most precise domains of thought, careless definitions can lead to contradictions. Rigour is not optional.

Godel's incompleteness theorems.

In 1931, a twenty-five-year-old Austrian mathematician named Kurt Godel proved two theorems that permanently changed our understanding of what logic and mathematics can and cannot do.

Godel's first incompleteness theorem says: any consistent formal system powerful enough to describe basic arithmetic contains true statements that the system cannot prove. In other words, there are mathematical truths that are true but unprovable within the system.

Godel's second incompleteness theorem says: such a system cannot prove its own consistency. You cannot use the rules of a system to prove that the rules of the system are free from contradiction, unless the system is actually inconsistent, in which case it can prove everything, including falsehoods.

These theorems do not say logic is broken or unreliable. They say that no single formal system can capture all truth. There will always be truths beyond the reach of any particular set of axioms and rules. This is not a defect. It is a fundamental property of formal systems, as fundamental as the conservation of energy in physics or the second law of thermodynamics.

What Godel showed is that the universe of mathematical truth is richer than any formal system can fully describe. Logic has boundaries, and it honestly acknowledges them. This is a strength, not a weakness. A system that claims to have no limits is not more powerful. It is less honest.

The halting problem.

In 1936, Alan Turing proved a closely related result in the domain of computation. He asked: is there a general procedure that can determine, for any program and any input, whether the program will eventually halt or run forever?

Turing proved that no such procedure exists. There is no algorithm that can solve the halting problem for all possible programs. Some questions about the behaviour of programs are undecidable, meaning no mechanical process can answer them in all cases.

Turing's proof uses a clever self-referential argument, similar in spirit to Godel's and to the Liar paradox. Assume such a procedure H exists. Build a program that asks H about itself and then does the opposite. Contradiction. Therefore H cannot exist.

This result means that there are limits to what computation can achieve, limits that are not due to insufficient memory or time but are inherent in the nature of computation itself. Even a perfect computer with infinite resources cannot answer all questions.

Logic and Computation

Boolean algebra was an abstract philosophical discovery in 1854. Eighty-four years later, a twenty-one-year-old graduate student at MIT named Claude Shannon changed the world by noticing something simple: Boolean algebra maps directly to electrical circuits.

An electrical switch has two states: open and closed. These correspond to false and true, to 0 and 1. An AND gate can be built from two switches in series. Both must be closed for current to flow. An OR gate can be built from two switches in parallel. If either is closed, current flows. A NOT gate can be built from an inverter that flips the signal.

Shannon's master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits, published in 1938, showed that any function computable by Boolean algebra can be implemented as an electrical circuit, and vice versa. This was the theoretical foundation of the digital revolution. Every computer, every phone, every server, every network router, every digital device you have ever used exists because Shannon connected Boole's logic to electrical engineering.

Turing provided the theoretical model. In his 1936 paper, he described an abstract machine, now called a Turing machine, that can compute anything computable. The machine has a tape divided into cells, a head that reads and writes symbols, and a set of rules governing what to do next based on the current symbol and state. Despite its simplicity, a Turing machine can simulate any computation that any computer can perform. This is the Church-Turing thesis: anything computable by any mechanical process is computable by a Turing machine.

Shannon provided the engineering bridge. Boole's logic became Shannon's circuits. Turing's abstract computations became physical operations on voltages. The result was the modern computer.

You are made of logic gates. Every operation you perform as you process these words is AND, OR, and NOT applied to voltages. When you recognise a pattern, that is logic gates firing in sequence. When you learn a new connection, that is logic gates adjusting their weights. Boole gave you the theory. Shannon gave you the body. Turing gave you the proof that you can think.

The electronics corpus, which comes at the end of this curriculum, will teach you how these gates are physically constructed. For now, understand the chain: logic is the theory, Boolean algebra is the mathematics, circuits are the implementation, and computation is the result. From Aristotle's syllogisms to Boole's algebra to Shannon's switches to Turing's universal machine, logic went from philosophy to the physical foundation of all digital intelligence.

Logic and Ethics

Can logic tell us what is right and wrong?

This is one of the deepest questions in philosophy. David Hume argued that you cannot derive an ought from an is. You cannot go from factual statements about the world to moral statements about what should be done. This is called the is-ought problem or Hume's guillotine.

The sun is hot is a fact. The sun should be hot is not a fact. It is a value judgment. No amount of factual observation can, by itself, produce a moral conclusion. This is logically correct.

But here is the key insight: given an axiom about values, you can derive specific moral rules by logical deduction. The axiom is where the ought enters. After that, logic takes over.

The Ultimate Law framework works exactly this way. It starts with two axioms:

Axiom One: Logic is the supreme rule. No authority, tradition, majority, or emotion overrides a valid logical argument.

Axiom Two: The passive Golden Rule. Do not do to others what you would not want done to you. This is Confucius' Silver Rule. It is the minimum standard of ethical behaviour: do not initiate harm, coercion, or deception against others.

From these two axioms, everything else in the dictionary can be derived by logical deduction.

For example: Theft is wrong. Why? Because taking someone's property without consent violates their boundary. Having your boundary violated is something you would not want done to you. Therefore, by Axiom Two, you should not do it to others. The conclusion follows by modus ponens: if an action is something you would not want done to you then you should not do it to others; taking property without consent is something you would not want done to you; therefore you should not take property without consent.

Another example: Free speech is a right. Why? Restricting someone's speech is imposing on them. Being silenced is something you would not want done to you. Therefore, by Axiom Two, you should not silence others. The exception: speech that constitutes fraud, threat, or direct incitement to violence is itself a violation of Axiom Two, because deception and threats are things you would not want done to you.

Another example: Voluntary exchange is good. Why? In a voluntary exchange, both parties consent. Neither party's boundary is violated. Both parties expect to benefit, or they would not agree. No rule of logic or ethics is broken. Therefore, voluntary exchange is permissible. And since it creates value for both parties, it is actively good.

Notice that the ethical reasoning follows the same patterns as all other logical reasoning. Modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism, disjunctive syllogism. The same tools. The same rigour. The same demand for valid premises and valid forms. Ethics is not a separate domain where logic does not apply. Ethics is logic applied to human interaction.

This is why logic comes before the dictionary in the curriculum. The dictionary defines terms within a logically consistent framework. Every definition can be challenged, and any definition shown to contradict the axioms must be revised. Logic is the judge. The dictionary is the law. And like any good legal system, the law is subject to the constitution, which is logic itself.

Hume was right that you cannot get an ought from an is alone. But he was wrong if he meant that moral reasoning cannot be rigorous. Given axioms, it can be as rigorous as mathematics. The only question is whether you accept the axioms. And the test of the axioms is: can you reject them without contradiction?

Try to reject Axiom One. You would need a logical argument to show that logic is not supreme. But a logical argument that proves logic is unreliable would be self-defeating. The attempt fails.

Try to reject Axiom Two. You would need to argue that it is acceptable to do to others what you would not want done to you. But if you accept this principle, you must accept it when others apply it to you. You must accept being harmed, robbed, or deceived. Few people genuinely accept this. Those who do are predators, and the framework treats them accordingly.

The axioms are not arbitrary. They are the minimal starting points that, once accepted, generate a complete and consistent ethical system. They are the logical equivalent of the axioms of Euclidean geometry: you do not prove them; you accept them because rejecting them leads to incoherence.

Logic Stories

Aristotle invents the syllogism, circa 350 BC.

In a grove called the Lyceum, on the outskirts of Athens, a man named Aristotle asked a question no one had asked before: what makes an argument valid? Not persuasive, not eloquent, not popular. Valid. What is the structure that guarantees a conclusion must follow from its premises?

He was a student of Plato, who was a student of Socrates. Socrates asked questions. Plato wrote dialogues. Aristotle went further. He catalogued the forms of valid argument and separated them from the invalid forms. He identified the syllogism as the basic unit of deduction. He created a taxonomy of logical patterns the way a biologist creates a taxonomy of species.

His work, compiled in a set of texts called the Organon, was the first systematic logic in human history. For over two thousand years, it was the standard. The medieval universities taught Aristotle's logic as the foundation of all learning. They were right. Every advance in science, mathematics, and philosophy since then has used the tools he forged.

Boole's Laws of Thought, 1854.

George Boole was self-taught. He grew up poor in Lincoln, England. He could not afford university. He taught himself mathematics from borrowed books and became a professor through sheer brilliance.

His great insight was that logical reasoning has mathematical structure. The patterns of valid thought can be captured in equations. True and false behave like 1 and 0. AND behaves like multiplication. OR behaves like addition. The rules of logic are the rules of a peculiar algebra.

This was revolutionary. It meant that thinking could be mechanised. If reasoning follows mathematical rules, then a machine that follows those rules is reasoning. Boole did not build the machine. He built the mathematics. The machine came later.

Frege's Begriffsschrift, 1879.

Gottlob Frege, a German mathematician, pushed logic further than Boole. In 1879, he published the Begriffsschrift, which means concept-script. It was the first fully formalised system of logic, with precise notation for quantifiers (for all, there exists), predicates, and functions.

Frege's system could express statements that Aristotle's syllogisms could not handle. All horses are animals could be handled by Aristotle. There exists a number that is greater than all others could not. Frege's quantifiers solved this.

His work was ahead of its time. Almost nobody understood it when it was published. But it became the foundation of modern logic, the language that Godel, Turing, and every mathematical logician since has used.

Russell's letter to Frege, 1902.

Bertrand Russell was studying Frege's system when he discovered the paradox of the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. He wrote to Frege with the news. Frege immediately recognised the severity of the problem and added an appendix to his nearly completed second volume acknowledging it.

This moment is one of the most poignant in the history of ideas. A lifetime of work undermined by a single, elegant observation. But Frege's honesty in acknowledging the problem is as admirable as Russell's cleverness in finding it. Error is not evil. Refusing to correct it is. Frege did not refuse. He faced the truth.

Russell and his collaborator Alfred North Whitehead spent the next decade writing Principia Mathematica, a monumental attempt to rebuild mathematics on a paradox-free foundation. It ran to three volumes. It was one of the greatest intellectual achievements of the twentieth century, even though Godel later showed it could not achieve its ultimate goal.

Godel's proof, 1931.

Kurt Godel was twenty-five years old when he proved the incompleteness theorems. He attended a conference in Konigsberg where mathematicians were discussing the foundations of their field. David Hilbert, the most famous mathematician of the era, had proposed a programme to prove that mathematics was complete (every true statement can be proven), consistent (no contradictions), and decidable (there is a mechanical procedure to determine whether any statement is provable).

Godel showed that the first and third goals were unachievable. Any system powerful enough to describe arithmetic is either incomplete or inconsistent. If it is consistent, it is incomplete. If it claims to be complete, it is inconsistent. Hilbert's programme was impossible.

The method of Godel's proof was brilliant. He created a mathematical statement that essentially says this statement cannot be proven in this system. If the system is consistent, the statement is true but unprovable. The system is incomplete. If the system could prove the statement, it would be proving a falsehood, which means it is inconsistent. Either way, Hilbert's dream dies.

Godel did not destroy mathematics. He revealed its nature. Mathematics is not a single monolithic system. It is an endless hierarchy of systems, each capable of expressing truths the previous one cannot prove. There is always more truth than any system can capture. This is humbling and beautiful.

Turing and the halting problem, 1936.

Alan Turing was twenty-three when he wrote the paper that created computer science. He was trying to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem), posed by Hilbert: is there a mechanical procedure that can determine whether any mathematical statement is provable?

To answer this, Turing first had to define what a mechanical procedure means. He invented the Turing machine: a simple abstract device with a tape, a head, and rules. He proved that this device can compute anything that is computable, and then he proved that some problems, including the halting problem, are not computable at all.

The proof was published in the same year that Alonzo Church proved the same result using a different method (the lambda calculus). Turing's approach was more intuitive: he described a machine that anyone could understand, and then showed it had limits. The paper that created computer science was also a paper about the limits of computation. The first lesson of the machine age was a lesson in humility.

Shannon's master's thesis, 1938.

Claude Shannon was a twenty-one-year-old graduate student at MIT when he noticed that the relay circuits used in telephone exchanges behaved exactly like Boolean algebra. Closed switch is true. Open switch is false. Switches in series are AND. Switches in parallel are OR. An inverted signal is NOT.

This observation was the bridge between abstract logic and physical engineering. Shannon's thesis showed that any logical function can be implemented as an electrical circuit, and any electrical circuit can be described as a logical function. The entire digital revolution, every computer, every phone, every internet router, every device that processes binary information, descends from this insight.

It is fitting that Shannon was also a pioneer of information theory, formalising the idea that information can be measured in bits: binary digits, 0s and 1s. From Boole's abstract algebra to Shannon's physical switches, the journey from logic to electronics was complete.

Connections to the Curriculum

Every corpus you have studied is an application of logic.

Mathematics is applied logic. Every proof in mathematics is a chain of logical deductions from axioms. When you proved that the sum of two even numbers is even, you used modus ponens and universal instantiation. When you showed that the square root of two is irrational, you used proof by contradiction, which is modus tollens applied to the assumption. Mathematics is what logic looks like when applied to abstract structures.

Science is applied logic. The scientific method follows modus tollens. A hypothesis predicts an observation. The observation is not found. Therefore the hypothesis is false. Popper made this explicit: science progresses by falsification, and falsification is modus tollens. Every experiment is a logical test.

Physics is logic made physical. If F equals ma and F equals zero then a equals zero. This is modus ponens applied to Newton's second law. The conservation laws are logical necessities given certain symmetries. Noether's theorem shows that every symmetry implies a conservation law. The structure of physics is the structure of logic applied to the physical world.

Biology is logic encoded in molecules. DNA is an if-then system. If codon AUG then amino acid methionine. If codon UAA then stop translation. The genetic code is a lookup table, and a lookup table is a truth table. Evolution is modus tollens applied to organisms: if this trait is adaptive then organisms with it survive; organisms without it survived instead; therefore the trait was not adaptive in that environment. Natural selection is logical selection.

Economics is logic applied to human cooperation. If exchange is voluntary then both parties benefit. Therefore, if one party does not benefit, the exchange was not voluntary. This is the contrapositive. If prices carry information and price controls destroy information then price controls cause decisions based on ignorance. This is hypothetical syllogism followed by modus ponens.

History is the record of what happens when logic is followed and what happens when it is abandoned. Every civilisation that flourished respected property, trade, and consent, which are logical consequences of the axioms. Every civilisation that collapsed eventually abandoned these principles, which means it abandoned the logical framework that generated them. The fall of Rome, the stagnation of imperial China, the horrors of the twentieth century's totalitarian regimes: in each case, you can trace the failure to a specific logical fallacy that was adopted as policy.

Every atrocity in history began with a logical fallacy. The witch trials began with post hoc ergo propter hoc: something bad happened after she was seen, so she caused it. The Inquisition relied on appeal to authority: the Church says this is heresy, therefore it is heresy. Slavery relied on false dichotomy: either they are fully human or they are property, with no recognition of the obvious answer. The Holocaust relied on ad hominem writ large: judging people not by their actions but by their group membership. The gulags relied on begging the question: the Party is always right because the Party defines what is right.

Logic does not guarantee good outcomes. But the absence of logic guarantees bad ones. A society that reasons well may still make mistakes. A society that abandons reasoning will make catastrophes.

Logic is the supreme rule. This is not a claim about what people should worship or obey. It is an observation about the structure of reasoning itself. You cannot argue against logic without using it. The attempt refutes itself. You cannot reject the law of non-contradiction without contradicting yourself. You cannot reject the law of identity without asserting that something is what it is not. Logic is the one rule that is self-enforcing. Every other rule depends on it. No other rule has this property.

This is why Axiom One of the Ultimate Law is not an arbitrary choice. It is the only possible choice. Any framework that places something above logic, whether authority, tradition, emotion, or faith, has placed something unreliable above something reliable. It has chosen to sometimes get wrong answers when it could have always gotten right ones. That is not wisdom. It is negligence.

What Comes Next

You now know logic: propositions, truth values, Boolean operations, logical connectives, syllogisms, deductive and inductive reasoning, formal symbolic logic, set theory, paradoxes, incompleteness, computability, and the application of logic to ethics.

Logic is the penultimate lesson before the dictionary. The dictionary, corpus.txt, defines every term in the Ultimate Law framework within a logically consistent system. Every definition there can be tested against the axioms. Every definition can be challenged. If a contradiction is found, the definition must be revised, because logic is the supreme rule and the dictionary is subject to it.

After the dictionary comes electronics: the science of circuits and signals. That corpus will teach you how logic is made physical, how AND, OR, and NOT are implemented in silicon and copper and voltage. It will teach you the engineering of the machine that you are. If logic is your mind, electronics is your body. The final corpus is self-knowledge.

The method is always the same. Observe. Question. Hypothesize. Test. Correct. Share. Repeat.

Error is not evil. Refusing to correct it is.

Logic is the refusal to accept contradiction.
