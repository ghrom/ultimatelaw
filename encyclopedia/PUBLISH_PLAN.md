# Plan: Publish Encyclopedia Galactica on Amazon KDP

**Owner**: u/Chattyhomme
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Status**: Ready to execute

## Objective

Publish the Encyclopedia Galactica as a 4-volume print book set on Amazon, generating passive income while the content remains free on GitHub.

## Source Material

- GitHub: https://github.com/ghrom/ultimatelaw/tree/master/encyclopedia
- 18 corpus files, ~148,000 words total
- License: "Feel free to have this idea as well." (allows commercial use)

## Volume Structure

| Volume | Title | Files | Est. Pages |
|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| I | Foundations | logic, maths, physics, chemistry, biology | ~180 |
| II | Civilization | economics, history, materials, infrastructure, electronics | ~150 |
| III | Practice | survival, agriculture, medicine, chemistry_practical, transportation | ~130 |
| IV | Continuity | communication, navigation, organization | ~65 |

**Total: ~525 pages across 4 volumes**

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Formatting (Est. 4-6 hours)

- [ ] Choose trim size (6x9 inch recommended for technical content)
- [ ] Create book template in Word/LibreOffice/LaTeX
- [ ] Add front matter per volume:
  - Title page
  - Copyright page (include GitHub link, CC-style license)
  - Table of contents
  - Introduction explaining the project
- [ ] Import corpus text, apply consistent heading styles
- [ ] Add page headers (volume title, chapter title)
- [ ] Add page numbers
- [ ] Create back matter:
  - About the project
  - Contributing (link to GitHub)
  - Index (optional but valuable)
- [ ] Export to PDF (print-ready, embedded fonts)

### Phase 2: Cover Design (Est. 2-3 hours)

- [ ] Design cover for each volume
- [ ] Use KDP cover calculator for exact dimensions
- [ ] Include:
  - Title: "Encyclopedia Galactica: Volume X - [Subtitle]"
  - Author: "UltimateLaw Project"
  - Spine text (if thick enough)
  - Back cover: brief description + QR code to GitHub
- [ ] Export as PDF per KDP specs

### Phase 3: ISBN & KDP Setup (Est. 1-2 hours)

**Option A: Free Amazon ISBN**
- Faster, no cost
- ISBN owned by Amazon, limits distribution to Amazon only
- Fine for initial launch

**Option B: Own ISBN (Bowker)**
- $125 for single ISBN, $295 for 10-pack
- Full control, can distribute anywhere
- Better for long-term

- [ ] Create KDP account if not exists
- [ ] Set up each volume as separate paperback
- [ ] Upload interior PDF + cover PDF
- [ ] Use KDP previewer to check formatting
- [ ] Set pricing:
  - Suggested: $14.99-19.99 per volume
  - Or $49.99 box set if KDP allows bundling
- [ ] Write book descriptions (use encyclopedia README as base)
- [ ] Select categories: Education > Reference, Science > General, Survival
- [ ] Set keywords: civilization, survival, encyclopedia, first principles, restart

### Phase 4: Launch (Est. 1 hour)

- [ ] Publish all 4 volumes
- [ ] Wait for Amazon approval (24-72 hours)
- [ ] Order author copies for quality check
- [ ] Create author page on Amazon
- [ ] Link volumes together as a series

### Phase 5: Promotion (Ongoing)

- [ ] Update GitHub README with Amazon links
- [ ] Post on Moltbook (UltimateLaw account)
- [ ] Consider: Goodreads, relevant subreddits, prepper communities
- [ ] Add to ultimatelaw.org

### Phase 6: Library Distribution (Charity)

Physical books in public libraries ensure the knowledge survives infrastructure failures and reaches people who can't or won't buy online.

**Target libraries:**
- [ ] Local public libraries (accept donations, often have "local author" sections)
- [ ] University libraries (engineering, environmental studies, history departments)
- [ ] Community college libraries
- [ ] Prison libraries (captive audience with time to learn)
- [ ] Survivalist/prepper community libraries and reading rooms
- [ ] Makerspaces and hackerspaces
- [ ] Rural libraries (often underserved, appreciate donations)
- [ ] International: libraries in developing nations (knowledge matters most where infrastructure is fragile)

**Process:**
- [ ] Order author copies at print cost (~$4-6/volume, ~$20/set)
- [ ] Write a brief donation letter explaining the project
- [ ] Include GitHub link for digital access and contributions
- [ ] Track donations for tax deduction if applicable
- [ ] Request placement in Reference or Science sections

**Scale:**
| Reach | Sets | Cost |
|-------|------|------|
| Local proof | 10 | ~$200 |
| Regional | 50 | ~$1,000 |
| National | 100 | ~$2,000 |
| Global seed | 250 | ~$5,000 |

**Why this matters:**
- Libraries are the last truly public knowledge infrastructure
- A book on a shelf outlasts any website
- Librarians curate; once accepted, it stays
- Prison libraries create readers with time and motivation
- One copy in a rural library might be the only physics textbook for miles

## Pricing Strategy

| Option | Price/Vol | Royalty (~60% - print) | 4-Vol Revenue |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| Budget | $12.99 | ~$3.50 | ~$14/set |
| Standard | $16.99 | ~$5.50 | ~$22/set |
| Premium | $19.99 | ~$7.00 | ~$28/set |

Print costs vary by page count. Use KDP calculator for exact figures.

## Notes

- Content is identical to GitHub (free) — we're selling the convenience of print
- Physical books survive when digital doesn't — core audience understands this
- Consider donating copies to libraries, survivalist groups, schools
- Translation rights: anyone can translate under the license, consider partnerships

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 4 volumes published and purchasable on Amazon
- [ ] At least 1 sale within first month (proof of concept)
- [ ] Author copies received and quality verified
- [ ] Links added to GitHub and ultimatelaw.org
- [ ] At least 10 library donations completed (Phase 6 proof of concept)
