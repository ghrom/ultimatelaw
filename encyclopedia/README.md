# Encyclopedia Galactica

**A complete curriculum for restarting civilization from first principles.**

This collection teaches everything needed to rebuild human civilization using simple English. A survivor with these texts can progress from immediate survival through agriculture, materials science, infrastructure, and medicine to communication, navigation, and social organization.

## Structure

## Principles

Every text in this encyclopedia follows these principles:

1. **Simple English.** A reader with basic literacy can understand. Technical terms are defined when first used.

2. **First principles.** Nothing is assumed. Each concept builds from observable facts.

3. **Practical procedures.** Not just theory — step-by-step instructions for actually doing things.

4. **Error correction.** "Error is not evil. Refusing to correct it is." Every text emphasizes observation, testing, and adjustment.

5. **Genesis pattern.** Each text connects to the chain of knowledge: "In the beginning there was infinite change. From change came the elements. From the elements came..."

## For Printed Publication

This curriculum is designed to work as a four-volume printed set:

- **Volume I: Foundations** — Logic, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology
- **Volume II: Civilization** — Economics, history, materials, infrastructure, electronics
- **Volume III: Practice** — Survival, agriculture, medicine, chemistry, transportation
- **Volume IV: Continuity** — Communication, navigation, organization
