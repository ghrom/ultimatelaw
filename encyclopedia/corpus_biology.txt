Biology: The Science of Life

This corpus teaches biology in simple, clear English. It builds on everything you have already learned. Mathematics gave you the language of numbers and patterns. The great teachers gave you wisdom and values. Science gave you the method: observe, question, hypothesize, test, correct, share, repeat. Physics gave you the laws that govern matter and energy, from atoms to galaxies.

Now you will learn what happens when matter organizes itself into something extraordinary: life. Biology is where atoms begin to copy themselves, repair their own errors, and fight against entropy. It is where chemistry becomes purpose. It is where the universe starts to look at itself.

The word biology comes from the Greek bios, meaning life, and logos, meaning study. Biology is the study of life.

What Is Life?

The question seems simple. Everyone knows the difference between a rock and a rabbit. But defining life precisely is harder than it looks. There is no single property that separates living from non-living. Instead, life is defined by a collection of properties that all living things share.

Living things grow. A seed becomes a tree. A baby becomes an adult. Growth means increasing in size and complexity over time.

Living things reproduce. A cat has kittens. A tree drops seeds. An amoeba splits in two. Reproduction means making copies of yourself. Without reproduction, life would end in a single generation.

Living things metabolize. Metabolism is the set of chemical reactions inside a living thing that convert food into energy and building materials. You eat bread. Your body breaks it down into glucose. Your cells burn the glucose for energy. This is metabolism. You learned in physics that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. In biology, metabolism is the transformation of chemical energy from food into the kinetic energy of movement, the thermal energy of body heat, and the chemical energy of new molecules.

Living things respond to stimuli. Touch a hot stove and you pull your hand back. A plant turns toward the light. A bacterium swims toward food. Living things detect changes in their environment and react to them.

Living things maintain homeostasis. Homeostasis means keeping the internal environment stable even when the outside changes. Your body temperature stays near 37 degrees Celsius whether you are in a snowstorm or a desert. Your blood sugar stays within a narrow range whether you just ate or have not eaten for hours. Homeostasis is the active maintenance of internal order.

Living things evolve. Over many generations, populations of living things change in response to their environment. Evolution is the slow accumulation of changes that adapt a population to its conditions. We will explore this in depth later.

There is one more property, perhaps the most important of all. Living things correct errors. DNA repair mechanisms fix mistakes in genetic code. The immune system identifies and destroys invaders. Evolution removes what does not work and keeps what does. Life is organized resistance to entropy, and error correction is how it resists.

You learned in physics that entropy always increases in a closed system. Order decays. Structures crumble. But the Earth is not a closed system. Energy pours in from the Sun. Life captures that energy and uses it to build and maintain extraordinary order: cells, organs, organisms, ecosystems. Life is a local decrease in entropy, paid for by the energy of a star.

In the beginning there was infinite change. From change came difference. From difference came the conditions for life. Biology is the story of what happened when the universe's infinite change produced patterns complex enough to sustain themselves.

The Cell

The cell is the basic unit of life. Every living thing is made of one or more cells. A bacterium is a single cell. A human body contains about 37 trillion cells. The cell is where life happens.

Robert Hooke was the first person to see cells. In 1665, he looked at a thin slice of cork through a microscope and saw tiny box-like structures. They reminded him of the small rooms in a monastery, called cells. He published his observations in a book called Micrographia. He was seeing the walls of dead plant cells, but he gave biology one of its most important words.

A few years later, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek of Delft, in the Netherlands, built microscopes far more powerful than Hooke's. In the 1670s and 1680s, he became the first person to see living cells: bacteria, protozoa, sperm cells, blood cells. He called them animalcules, tiny animals. He opened a window into a world no one knew existed.

The cell theory, developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, states three things. First: all living things are made of cells. Second: the cell is the basic unit of life. Third: all cells come from pre-existing cells. No cell arises spontaneously from non-living matter. Every cell in your body descended from the single fertilized egg that began your life, which descended from cells going back billions of years in an unbroken chain.

Prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

There are two fundamental types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

Prokaryotic cells are simpler and smaller. They have no nucleus. Their DNA floats freely in the cell. Bacteria are prokaryotes. Archaea are prokaryotes. Prokaryotes were the first forms of life on Earth, appearing roughly 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. For about two billion years, they were the only life on Earth.

Eukaryotic cells are larger and more complex. They have a nucleus, a membrane-bound compartment that contains the DNA. They also have other specialized compartments called organelles. Animals, plants, fungi, and protists are all eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cells appeared roughly 1.5 to 2 billion years ago, likely when a prokaryotic cell engulfed another prokaryotic cell in a partnership that became permanent. This is called endosymbiosis.

The cell membrane.

Every cell is surrounded by a cell membrane, also called the plasma membrane. It is a thin, flexible barrier made mostly of molecules called phospholipids, arranged in a double layer.

The cell membrane decides what enters and what leaves. It is selectively permeable. Some molecules can pass through freely. Others require special protein channels to get in. Others are blocked entirely. The membrane is the cell's boundary.

This is worth pausing on. The cell membrane is the original boundary. It separates self from non-self, inside from outside, order from chaos. Without it, the carefully organized chemistry of the cell would dissolve into the surrounding environment and life would end.

The cell membrane does not block everything. It allows in what the cell needs: nutrients, water, signals from other cells. It keeps out what would harm the cell. It is a voluntary boundary. What enters must be permitted. What leaves is regulated. The cell's integrity depends on this boundary being maintained and respected.

You will see this principle again and again in biology and beyond. Boundaries matter. Whether it is a cell membrane, a skin, a property line, or a national border, the principle is the same: without a boundary, there is no identity. Without selective permeability, there is no control. Without control, there is no life.

The nucleus.

The nucleus is the largest organelle in a eukaryotic cell. It contains the cell's DNA, the instructions for building and running the cell. The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, which has pores that allow molecules to pass in and out.

The nucleus is the cell's library. It stores the blueprints. When the cell needs to build a protein, it copies the relevant section of DNA into a molecule called messenger RNA, which leaves the nucleus through the pores and travels to the ribosomes, where the protein is built.

Mitochondria: the powerhouses of the cell.

Mitochondria are organelles that generate energy for the cell. They take in glucose and oxygen and produce a molecule called ATP, adenosine triphosphate, which is the cell's energy currency. Nearly every action the cell performs is powered by ATP.

Mitochondria have their own DNA, separate from the DNA in the nucleus. This is strong evidence for the endosymbiosis theory: mitochondria were once free-living bacteria that were engulfed by a larger cell. The relationship was beneficial to both. The bacterium got a safe home. The larger cell got a vastly more efficient energy supply. Over billions of years, the partnership became permanent. The bacterium became the mitochondrion.

This is one of the great examples of cooperation in biology. Two organisms merged into something greater than either could be alone. Mutualism, not competition, produced the eukaryotic cell.

Other organelles.

Ribosomes are the factories that build proteins. They read the messenger RNA instructions and assemble amino acids into protein chains. Every cell, prokaryotic or eukaryotic, has ribosomes.

The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes that helps manufacture and transport proteins and lipids. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes and makes proteins. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum makes lipids and detoxifies chemicals.

The Golgi apparatus packages and ships proteins to their destinations, inside or outside the cell. It is the cell's post office.

Lysosomes are the cell's recycling centers. They break down worn-out parts, invaders, and waste using powerful enzymes. Without lysosomes, the cell would accumulate debris and eventually die. This is entropy management at the cellular level.

In plant cells, chloroplasts capture light energy from the Sun and convert it into chemical energy through photosynthesis. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own DNA and were once free-living organisms, cyanobacteria, that were engulfed by a larger cell. Another partnership. Another merger that changed the world.

Cell division.

Cells reproduce by dividing. There are two main types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis.

Mitosis produces two identical daughter cells from one parent cell. It is how your body grows, repairs damage, and replaces worn-out cells. Every time a cell divides by mitosis, it copies its entire DNA and distributes one copy to each daughter cell. Your skin cells, blood cells, and muscle cells all divide by mitosis.

Meiosis is different. It produces four daughter cells, each with half the DNA of the parent cell. Meiosis is how sex cells are made: eggs and sperm. When an egg and a sperm combine during fertilization, the full amount of DNA is restored. This is why you have half your DNA from your mother and half from your father.

Meiosis also shuffles the DNA. During meiosis, sections of DNA are swapped between chromosomes in a process called crossing over. This creates new combinations of genes that never existed before. Meiosis is the engine of genetic diversity, and genetic diversity is the raw material of evolution.

DNA and Genetics

DNA is the molecule of life. It carries the instructions for building and running every living thing on Earth. From a bacterium to a blue whale, from a mushroom to a maple tree, every living thing uses the same molecular language: DNA.

The discovery of DNA's structure.

By the early 1950s, scientists knew that DNA carried genetic information, but no one knew what the molecule looked like. Three groups raced to solve the puzzle.

Rosalind Franklin, working at King's College London, used X-ray crystallography to photograph DNA. Her technique was painstaking: she aimed X-rays at crystals of DNA and captured the pattern of scattered rays on film. In 1952, she produced Photo 51, one of the most famous images in science. It clearly showed that DNA had a helical, spiral-staircase shape.

James Watson and Francis Crick, working at Cambridge, used Franklin's data along with their own model-building approach. In April 1953, they published a paper in the journal Nature describing the structure of DNA as a double helix: two strands twisted around each other, held together by pairs of chemical bases.

Watson and Crick famously wrote: It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material. In one sentence, they pointed out that the structure of DNA explains how life copies itself.

Source: James Watson and Francis Crick, Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids, Nature, April 25, 1953.

Rosalind Franklin's contribution was essential. Without Photo 51, Watson and Crick might not have solved the structure. Franklin died of ovarian cancer in 1958, at age 37, likely caused by her extensive work with X-rays. She did not share the Nobel Prize awarded to Watson, Crick, and Maurice Wilkins in 1962, as Nobel Prizes are not given posthumously. History has increasingly recognized her as the unsung hero of the discovery.

The structure of DNA.

DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. It is a long, thin molecule shaped like a twisted ladder: the double helix.

The sides of the ladder are made of sugar and phosphate molecules, alternating like the rails of a spiral staircase.

The rungs of the ladder are made of pairs of chemical bases. There are four bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. They are abbreviated A, T, G, and C.

The bases pair according to a strict rule. A always pairs with T. G always pairs with C. This is called complementary base pairing. If you know the sequence on one strand, you can immediately deduce the sequence on the other. If one strand reads ATGCCA, the other reads TACGGT.

A single molecule of human DNA contains about 3.2 billion base pairs, arranged in a specific sequence. This sequence is the human genome. It contains the instructions for building a human body.

You learned in mathematics that binary code uses two symbols, 0 and 1, to encode all information. DNA uses four symbols, A, T, G, and C. It is a quaternary code rather than a binary code, but the principle is identical: discrete symbols arranged in sequence encode information. Your body runs on a four-letter alphabet instead of a two-letter one.

If you printed the human genome as text, it would fill about 200 volumes of 1,000 pages each. All this information fits inside the nucleus of a single cell, coiled so tightly that roughly two meters of DNA are packed into a space six micrometers across.

Genes.

A gene is a section of DNA that contains the instructions for building one protein, or sometimes a set of related proteins. Humans have roughly 20,000 to 25,000 genes. Each gene is a specific sequence of bases that tells the cell which amino acids to assemble, in what order, to build a particular protein.

Proteins do almost everything in the cell. Enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions. Structural proteins like collagen give tissues their strength. Hemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen in your blood. Antibodies are proteins that fight infection. Your genes determine which proteins you can make, and your proteins determine what your body can do.

Not all DNA codes for proteins. Only about 1.5 percent of the human genome consists of genes. The rest includes regulatory sequences that control when and where genes are turned on, structural elements, and regions whose function is still being studied.

DNA replication.

When a cell divides, it must first copy its entire DNA so that each daughter cell gets a complete set of instructions. This process is called DNA replication.

The double helix unzips down the middle, separating the two strands. Each strand then serves as a template for building a new complementary strand. Where the old strand has an A, the new strand adds a T. Where it has a G, the new strand adds a C. The result is two identical copies of the original DNA molecule.

This is the most important copy operation in the universe. Every time a cell divides, roughly 3.2 billion base pairs must be copied accurately. The error rate is astonishingly low: about one mistake per billion base pairs copied, after error correction. This is like copying the entire Encyclopedia Britannica and making less than one typo.

DNA repair: error correction in biology.

DNA is constantly under attack. Ultraviolet light from the Sun, chemicals in the environment, and even normal metabolic processes damage DNA thousands of times per day in every cell.

Cells have an elaborate set of DNA repair mechanisms. Special enzymes patrol the DNA, looking for errors. When they find a mistake, a misspelled base, a broken strand, a chemical modification, they cut out the damaged section and replace it with the correct sequence using the other strand as a template.

This is error correction, the same principle you have seen throughout the curriculum. In mathematics, you check your work. In science, you test hypotheses and discard what fails. In physics, you observe the universe correcting our guesses. In biology, cells physically repair their own instructions.

When DNA repair fails, the result is a mutation: a permanent change in the DNA sequence. Most mutations are harmless. Some are harmful. Very rarely, one is beneficial. Mutations that are harmful may cause disease, including cancer, which is fundamentally a disease of broken error correction. When the mechanisms that control cell division are damaged and cannot be repaired, cells divide without restraint.

Error is not evil. Refusing to correct it is. Biology demonstrates this at the molecular level. Thousands of errors occur every day, and the cell corrects nearly all of them. It is the failure to correct that causes harm.

Mendel and inheritance.

Long before anyone knew about DNA, a monk named Gregor Mendel figured out the basic rules of inheritance by growing peas in his monastery garden in Brno, in what is now the Czech Republic.

Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel crossed thousands of pea plants and carefully recorded the results. He tracked seven traits: seed shape, seed color, flower color, pod shape, pod color, flower position, and plant height. Each trait had two forms: round or wrinkled seeds, yellow or green seeds, purple or white flowers, and so on.

Mendel discovered that traits are inherited in discrete units, which we now call genes. He found that each plant has two copies of each gene, one from each parent. Some versions of a gene are dominant and some are recessive. A plant with one dominant and one recessive copy shows the dominant trait. The recessive trait only appears when both copies are recessive.

Mendel published his results in 1866, but the scientific world ignored him. His paper sat unread for over thirty years. In 1900, three scientists independently rediscovered Mendel's laws and found his original paper. Mendel finally received the recognition he deserved, sixteen years after his death.

Source: Gregor Mendel, Experiments on Plant Hybridization, 1866.

Mendel's story is a lesson in the power of patient, careful observation and the tragedy of ideas ahead of their time. He was right. The world was not ready. But truth does not depend on recognition. It waits.

Evolution

Evolution is the central idea of biology. Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. This statement, made by biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1973, is as true today as when he wrote it. Evolution connects every fact in biology into a single coherent framework.

What is evolution?

Evolution is the change in inherited traits in a population over generations. It is not something that happens to an individual. It happens to populations over time. You do not evolve. Your species evolves.

Evolution has four requirements. First: variation. Individuals in a population differ from each other. No two zebras have exactly the same stripes. No two humans have exactly the same DNA. This variation is the raw material.

Second: inheritance. Traits must be passed from parents to offspring through DNA. If variation existed but was not inherited, it would vanish each generation.

Third: selection. Some variations are better suited to the environment than others. Individuals with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits to the next generation.

Fourth: time. Evolution works slowly. Small changes accumulate over thousands and millions of generations. Given enough time, small changes produce large differences.

Charles Darwin and natural selection.

Charles Darwin was born in 1809 in Shrewsbury, England. In 1831, at age twenty-two, he sailed on HMS Beagle as the ship's naturalist on a five-year voyage around the world.

The Beagle visited the Galapagos Islands in September 1835. Darwin noticed that the finches on different islands had different beak shapes. Some had thick beaks for cracking hard seeds. Others had thin beaks for catching insects. Others had medium beaks for eating a variety of foods. Each species was adapted to the food sources on its particular island.

Darwin spent over twenty years developing his theory after returning from the voyage. He gathered enormous evidence from fossils, animal breeding, and the geographic distribution of species. In 1858, Alfred Russel Wallace independently arrived at the same theory. This prompted Darwin to finally publish.

In 1859, Darwin published On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. It is one of the most important books ever written. In it, Darwin argued that species are not fixed and unchanging. They change over time through natural selection: the survival and reproduction of individuals best suited to their environment.

Source: Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species, 1859.

Natural selection is not random. This is a common misunderstanding. Mutations are random. They occur without regard to whether they will be helpful or harmful. But selection is the opposite of random. It is a filter. It systematically keeps what works and removes what does not. A random process generates variation. A non-random process selects from that variation. The combination produces adaptation.

Evolution is the universe's error correction applied to life. Organisms that have errors too severe to survive are removed by natural selection. Organisms that function well enough to reproduce pass their designs forward. Over time, the designs improve. Not toward any predetermined goal, but toward better fit with the environment.

You learned in science that error is not evil, but refusing to correct it is. Evolution is nature's refusal to stop correcting. It has been running for nearly four billion years. The results are the staggering diversity and complexity of life on Earth.

Evidence for evolution.

The evidence for evolution comes from many independent sources, all pointing to the same conclusion.

Fossils preserve the remains of organisms that lived millions of years ago. The fossil record shows clear patterns of change over time. Simple organisms appear in older rocks. More complex organisms appear in younger rocks. Transitional fossils show intermediate forms: Tiktaalik, a 375-million-year-old fish with limb-like fins, shows the transition from water to land. Archaeopteryx, a 150-million-year-old creature with both feathers and teeth, shows the transition from dinosaurs to birds.

Homologous structures are body parts that share the same underlying anatomy despite serving different functions. A human arm, a whale flipper, a bat wing, and a dog leg all contain the same bones in the same arrangement: humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals, phalanges. These structures make sense only if these animals inherited them from a common ancestor and they were modified over time for different purposes.

DNA evidence is the most powerful of all. All living things use the same genetic code. The same four bases. The same codons for the same amino acids. The more closely related two species are, the more similar their DNA. Humans and chimpanzees share about 98.7 percent of their DNA. Humans and bananas share about 60 percent. This is not a coincidence. It is common descent.

Embryology shows that the embryos of very different animals look remarkably similar in early development. A human embryo, a chicken embryo, and a fish embryo all have gill slits and tails at certain stages. These structures are inherited from common ancestors, even though they may not persist in the adult form.

Biogeography shows that species are distributed across the Earth in patterns that make sense only through evolution. Islands have unique species found nowhere else, descended from ancestors that arrived and then evolved in isolation. The Galapagos finches are the classic example, but the pattern repeats worldwide.

Common descent.

All life on Earth shares a common ancestor. This is one of the most profound and well-supported conclusions in all of science.

The evidence is overwhelming. All life uses DNA. All life uses the same genetic code. All cells use ATP for energy. All cells have ribosomes. All cells have cell membranes made of phospholipids. These shared features are best explained by inheritance from a single ancestral population.

The last universal common ancestor, called LUCA, lived roughly 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. LUCA was not the first living thing, but it was the ancestor from which all current life descends. We do not know exactly what LUCA looked like, but by comparing the genes shared by all living things, we can infer that it was a single-celled organism that lived in a hot, chemical-rich environment, possibly near hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor.

From that single origin, all the diversity of life on Earth has descended. Every bacterium, every tree, every mushroom, every insect, every whale, every human: all are cousins, connected by an unbroken chain of cells dividing and DNA copying, stretching back nearly four billion years.

The Tree of Life

Life is classified into three great domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.

Bacteria are single-celled prokaryotes found everywhere on Earth: in soil, water, air, inside your body, in boiling hot springs, in Antarctic ice. They are the most abundant organisms on the planet. Many are essential for life. They decompose dead matter, recycle nutrients, fix nitrogen from the air into forms plants can use, and live in your gut helping you digest food.

Archaea are also single-celled prokaryotes, but they are genetically and biochemically distinct from bacteria. Many archaea live in extreme environments: boiling acidic springs, deep ocean vents, highly salty lakes. They were once thought to be a type of bacteria, but molecular analysis revealed they are a separate domain, as different from bacteria as you are.

Eukarya includes all organisms with eukaryotic cells: animals, plants, fungi, and protists. The domain Eukarya contains the familiar life we see around us, from oak trees to octopi to humans.

Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, created the modern system of biological classification in 1735. He organized living things into a hierarchy: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species. Every species has a unique two-part name, called a binomial. Humans are Homo sapiens. The domestic cat is Felis catus. The common daisy is Bellis perennis.

Source: Carl Linnaeus, Systema Naturae, 1735.

Linnaeus classified organisms by their physical similarities. Today, classification is based primarily on evolutionary relationships revealed by DNA. The tree of life is not a metaphor. It is a diagram of descent. Every branch point represents a common ancestor. Every tip represents a living or extinct species. The tree connects all life into one family.

Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth. Scientists have described roughly 1.5 million species, but estimates of the total number range from 8 million to over 100 million, including species not yet discovered. Most undiscovered species are insects, deep-sea organisms, and microbes.

Biodiversity matters because ecosystems depend on the interactions between many species. When species are lost, the web of interactions is weakened. Ecosystems become less resilient, less productive, and less able to recover from disturbance. Biodiversity is not decoration. It is infrastructure.

Ecosystems

An ecosystem is a community of living things interacting with each other and with their non-living environment. A forest is an ecosystem. A coral reef is an ecosystem. A pond is an ecosystem. Even your gut, with its trillions of bacteria, is an ecosystem.

Energy flow.

Energy enters most ecosystems as sunlight. Plants capture light energy and convert it to chemical energy through photosynthesis. This makes plants the producers: they produce the energy that everything else depends on.

Photosynthesis is one of the most important chemical reactions on Earth. Plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil. Using light energy from the Sun, they combine these into glucose, a sugar, and release oxygen as a byproduct. The equation is: carbon dioxide plus water plus light energy yields glucose plus oxygen.

Every breath of oxygen you take was produced by photosynthesis. Every calorie you eat was captured from sunlight by a plant, either directly if you eat plants, or indirectly if you eat animals that ate plants.

Animals are consumers. They cannot make their own food. They must eat other organisms. Herbivores eat plants. Carnivores eat animals. Omnivores eat both. Decomposers, such as fungi and bacteria, break down dead organisms and return their nutrients to the soil, where plants can use them again.

Food chains and food webs.

A food chain is a simple sequence showing who eats whom. Grass is eaten by a rabbit. The rabbit is eaten by a fox. The fox dies and is broken down by bacteria. Energy flows from one level to the next.

At each level, most of the energy is lost as heat. This is the second law of thermodynamics at work. A rabbit uses most of the energy from the grass for its own metabolism: moving, breathing, keeping warm. Only about 10 percent of the energy at one level passes to the next. This is why there are many plants, fewer herbivores, and even fewer top predators. The energy pyramid gets narrower at each level.

A food web is more realistic than a food chain. In nature, organisms eat many different things and are eaten by many different predators. The web of connections is complex and interconnected. This complexity gives ecosystems resilience. If one species declines, others can compensate. If the web is too simplified, with too few connections, it becomes fragile.

Nutrient cycles.

Energy flows through an ecosystem in one direction: from the Sun, through producers, through consumers, and out as heat. It is not recycled.

But matter is recycled. The carbon atoms in your body have been on Earth for billions of years. They have been in the atmosphere, in the ocean, in rocks, in plants, in dinosaurs, and now in you. They will be in something else after you.

The carbon cycle moves carbon through the atmosphere, living things, the ocean, and the ground. Plants absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Animals release carbon dioxide during respiration. Decomposition releases carbon from dead organisms. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon that was stored underground for millions of years, adding it back to the atmosphere.

The nitrogen cycle moves nitrogen from the atmosphere into living things and back. Nitrogen gas makes up 78 percent of the atmosphere, but most organisms cannot use it directly. Special bacteria called nitrogen-fixing bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which plants can absorb. Other bacteria convert nitrogen compounds back into nitrogen gas, completing the cycle. Without these bacteria, life as we know it could not exist.

The water cycle moves water from the ocean to the atmosphere to land and back. Evaporation lifts water from oceans and lakes into the atmosphere. Condensation forms clouds. Precipitation returns water to the land as rain or snow. Rivers carry it back to the ocean. This cycle drives weather, shapes landscapes, and sustains all terrestrial life.

Symbiosis: living together.

Symbiosis means living together. It describes close, long-term relationships between different species. There are three main types.

Mutualism benefits both species. Bees visit flowers to collect nectar. In the process, they carry pollen from flower to flower, helping the plant reproduce. The bee gets food. The plant gets pollinated. Both benefit. Neither is forced. This is voluntary exchange in nature, and it works because both sides gain.

Flowers evolved bright colors and sweet nectar specifically to attract pollinators. Bees evolved specialized structures for collecting and carrying pollen. Each shaped the other through millions of years of mutual adaptation. This is coevolution: two species evolving in response to each other.

The mitochondria inside your cells are another example. Once free-living bacteria, now permanent partners. The relationship is so deep that neither can survive without the other. This mutualism is 1.5 to 2 billion years old.

Commensalism benefits one species without harming the other. A bird building a nest in a tree benefits from the shelter. The tree is neither helped nor harmed. Barnacles attaching to a whale get free transportation. The whale is unaffected.

Parasitism benefits one species at the expense of another. A tapeworm lives inside an animal's gut, absorbing nutrients that the animal ate. The tapeworm benefits. The animal is harmed. A tick attaches to a dog and drinks its blood. The tick benefits. The dog is harmed.

Parasitism is the biological equivalent of coercion. The parasite takes without consent. The host does not benefit and would remove the parasite if it could. The relationship is involuntary. This is why immune systems evolved: to detect and remove parasites and other organisms that cross the body's boundary without permission.

Mutualism thrives. Parasitism triggers defense. Nature illustrates the same principle that the great teachers taught and the Ultimate Law codifies: voluntary exchange creates value for both sides. Involuntary taking creates harm and provokes resistance.

Cooperation in nature.

Cooperation is far more common in nature than most people realize. Darwin emphasized competition, but modern biology has revealed that cooperation is equally fundamental.

Cells in your body cooperate. Each cell performs its specialized role for the benefit of the whole organism. Neurons transmit signals. Muscle cells contract. White blood cells fight infection. No cell acts only for itself.

Social insects cooperate. Ants, bees, and termites build complex societies where individuals work together for the colony. Honeybees communicate the location of food through dances. Ants lay chemical trails for others to follow.

Cleaner fish eat parasites off larger fish. Both benefit. The cleaner gets food. The larger fish gets cleaned. This relationship is so well-established that larger fish visit specific cleaning stations on coral reefs and hold still while tiny fish swim inside their mouths.

Trees in a forest are connected by underground networks of fungal threads called mycorrhizae. Through these networks, trees share nutrients with each other. Older trees send sugar to younger trees growing in the shade. Dying trees dump their remaining nutrients into the network for others to use. The forest is not just a collection of competing individuals. It is a cooperative network.

Reciprocal altruism is cooperation based on the expectation of future return. A vampire bat that has fed will share blood with a hungry bat from its group. Bats that refuse to share are remembered and excluded from future sharing. This is the Silver Rule operating in the animal kingdom: cooperate with those who cooperate, withdraw cooperation from those who cheat.

The Human Body

The human body is an organism of extraordinary complexity, built from about 37 trillion cells working together. It has multiple organ systems, each performing essential functions.

The skeletal system provides structure and support. You have 206 bones. Bones protect organs, anchor muscles, and store minerals. They are not dead scaffolding. Bones are living tissue, constantly being remodeled.

The muscular system allows movement. You have over 600 muscles. Skeletal muscles move your bones. Smooth muscles line your organs and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle, found only in the heart, beats about 100,000 times per day without you thinking about it.

The circulatory system transports blood throughout the body. The heart pumps blood through arteries to deliver oxygen and nutrients to every cell. Veins carry blood back to the heart. Capillaries, the tiniest blood vessels, connect arteries and veins and are where the actual exchange of gases and nutrients happens. Your blood travels roughly 19,000 kilometers through your body every day.

The respiratory system handles breathing. Your lungs take in oxygen from the air and release carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism. Each breath brings fresh oxygen to the blood and removes carbon dioxide. You breathe about 20,000 times per day.

The digestive system breaks down food into molecules small enough to be absorbed. The journey from mouth to end takes about 24 to 72 hours. Mechanical digestion, chewing and churning, breaks food into smaller pieces. Chemical digestion uses enzymes to break molecules apart. Nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine. Water is absorbed in the large intestine. Waste is expelled.

The nervous system is the body's communication network. The brain and spinal cord form the central nervous system. Nerves branching throughout the body form the peripheral nervous system. Electrical signals travel along nerves at speeds up to 120 meters per second. The nervous system controls everything from your heartbeat to your thoughts to the movement of your fingers.

The brain is the most complex object we know of in the universe. A human brain contains roughly 86 billion neurons, each connected to thousands of others. The total number of connections, called synapses, is estimated at 100 to 500 trillion. These connections store memories, generate thoughts, produce consciousness, and let you read and understand this sentence.

The endocrine system uses chemical messengers called hormones to coordinate slow, long-lasting processes: growth, metabolism, reproduction, mood. Hormones are produced by glands and travel through the blood to target organs. Insulin from the pancreas regulates blood sugar. Adrenaline from the adrenal glands prepares the body for sudden action. Melatonin from the pineal gland regulates sleep.

The reproductive system allows organisms to produce offspring. In humans, the male reproductive system produces sperm. The female reproductive system produces eggs and provides the environment for a developing embryo. Reproduction is how DNA is transmitted across generations, how the chain of life continues.

The immune system.

The immune system deserves special attention. It is your body's defence against invaders: bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and even your own cells when they malfunction.

The immune system operates like a detection and response system. It identifies threats, investigates them, and neutralizes them.

The first line of defence is physical barriers. Your skin blocks most pathogens. Mucous membranes in your nose and throat trap particles. Stomach acid destroys many bacteria. These are passive defences, like walls around a city.

The second line is the innate immune system. It responds quickly but not specifically. White blood cells called phagocytes engulf and destroy anything they recognize as foreign. Inflammation increases blood flow to damaged areas, bringing more immune cells. Fever raises body temperature, making conditions less favorable for many pathogens.

The third line is the adaptive immune system. It is slower but highly specific. When a new pathogen invades, specialized white blood cells called lymphocytes learn to recognize it. B cells produce antibodies, proteins that bind to the specific pathogen and mark it for destruction. T cells destroy infected cells directly. After the infection is cleared, memory cells remain in the body for years or decades, ready to respond immediately if the same pathogen returns. This is why you rarely get the same disease twice. This is the basis of vaccination.

The immune system practices something remarkably like the scientific method. It encounters an unknown agent. It generates a hypothesis about the invader's identity by producing antibodies of various shapes. It tests whether the antibodies bind to the invader. If they do, it mass-produces the successful antibody. If they do not, it tries again. When the threat is eliminated, it stores the solution in memory for future use. Observe, hypothesize, test, correct, remember. The method is the same.

The immune system also enforces boundaries. It distinguishes self from non-self. It allows the body's own cells to pass unchallenged. It attacks anything it identifies as foreign. When this system goes wrong, when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues, the result is autoimmune disease. When it fails to detect a threat, infection spreads. Proper boundary enforcement is essential for health.

Microorganisms

Microorganisms, or microbes, are living things too small to see without a microscope. They include bacteria, archaea, protists, some fungi, and some algae. Viruses are also microscopic but are not considered truly alive.

Bacteria: not all bad.

When most people hear the word bacteria, they think of disease. But the vast majority of bacteria are harmless, and many are essential for life.

Your gut contains trillions of bacteria, collectively called the gut microbiome. These bacteria help you digest food, produce vitamins, train your immune system, and protect you from harmful microbes. You have roughly as many bacterial cells in your body as human cells. You are as much bacteria as you are human.

Bacteria in the soil decompose dead organisms, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into forms that plants can use. Without these bacteria, the nitrogen cycle would collapse and most plant life would die.

Bacteria are used in food production. Yogurt, cheese, sauerkraut, and kimchi all depend on bacterial fermentation. Bacteria are used in medicine to produce insulin and other drugs. Bacteria are used in industry for waste treatment and bioremediation.

Some bacteria do cause disease: tuberculosis, cholera, plague, strep throat. But disease-causing bacteria are a tiny minority of all bacterial species. Painting all bacteria as enemies would be like declaring all humans criminals because some commit crimes. Judgment must be specific, not collective.

Viruses: not quite alive.

A virus is a packet of genetic material, DNA or RNA, wrapped in a protein coat. It has no cells, no metabolism, no ability to reproduce on its own. To reproduce, a virus must infect a living cell and hijack its machinery to make copies of itself.

Because viruses cannot metabolize or reproduce independently, many biologists do not consider them truly alive. They exist in a grey zone between life and non-life. They are molecular parasites: packets of information that exploit cellular machinery.

Viruses cause many diseases: influenza, measles, HIV, COVID-19, the common cold. They also play important ecological roles, helping to regulate bacterial populations in oceans and soil.

Fungi: the decomposers.

Fungi include mushrooms, yeasts, and molds. They are neither plants nor animals. They form their own kingdom.

Fungi are the great decomposers. They break down dead organic matter, recycling it back into the ecosystem. Without fungi, dead trees and leaves would pile up and nutrients would be locked away forever.

Many fungi form mutualistic relationships with plants. Mycorrhizal fungi attach to plant roots and extend the root system by orders of magnitude. The fungi provide the plant with water and minerals from the soil. The plant provides the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis. Over 90 percent of land plants depend on mycorrhizal partnerships.

Yeasts are single-celled fungi used in baking and brewing for thousands of years. They ferment sugars into carbon dioxide, which makes bread rise, and alcohol, which makes beer and wine. Penicillium, a mold, gave us the first antibiotic.

Pasteur and germ theory.

For most of human history, people did not know what caused disease. Many believed in miasma, the idea that disease was caused by bad air. Others believed disease was divine punishment.

Louis Pasteur, a French chemist, changed this. In the 1860s, he demonstrated that microorganisms cause fermentation and spoilage. He showed that broth sealed in a sterile flask stays clear, but broth exposed to air becomes cloudy with microbial growth. He also disproved spontaneous generation, the ancient belief that life could arise from non-living matter, by designing his famous swan-necked flask experiment.

Pasteur went on to develop pasteurization, a process of heating food to kill harmful microbes, and created vaccines for anthrax and rabies.

Source: Louis Pasteur, various publications, 1857-1885.

Robert Koch, a German physician working in the 1870s and 1880s, established the rigorous criteria for proving that a specific microorganism causes a specific disease. Koch's postulates require: the microbe must be found in all cases of the disease; it must be isolated and grown in pure culture; the cultured microbe must cause the disease when introduced to a healthy host; and it must be re-isolated from the new host. This is the scientific method applied directly to medicine.

Fleming and penicillin.

In 1928, Alexander Fleming, a Scottish bacteriologist working at St Mary's Hospital in London, returned from holiday to find that a mold had contaminated one of his bacterial cultures. He noticed something remarkable: the bacteria around the mold were dead. The mold was producing a substance that killed bacteria.

The mold was Penicillium notatum. The substance was penicillin. Fleming published his finding, but he did not have the resources to develop it into a medicine.

More than a decade later, Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain at Oxford University developed a way to produce penicillin in large quantities. By 1944, penicillin was saving the lives of wounded soldiers in the Second World War. It was the first antibiotic, a drug that kills bacteria, and it ushered in the antibiotic era.

Source: Alexander Fleming, On the Antibacterial Action of Cultures of a Penicillium, 1929.

Fleming's discovery was accidental, but it was not luck. Fleming noticed the mold because he was observant. He investigated because he was curious. He published because he was honest. Chance favors the prepared mind, as Pasteur said.

Semmelweis and handwashing.

In the 1840s, Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician working in the Vienna General Hospital. He noticed that women giving birth in the ward staffed by doctors died of childbed fever at five times the rate of women in the ward staffed by midwives.

Semmelweis investigated. He discovered that doctors were going directly from performing autopsies to delivering babies without washing their hands. They were carrying something deadly from the dead to the living.

In 1847, Semmelweis introduced mandatory handwashing with chlorinated lime solution. The death rate dropped immediately from about 10 percent to under 2 percent.

But the medical establishment rejected his findings. Doctors were offended by the suggestion that their hands were dirty. Semmelweis was mocked, dismissed, and eventually committed to an asylum, where he died in 1865 at age 47.

Decades later, Pasteur's germ theory and Koch's postulates proved Semmelweis right. Handwashing is now the single most effective way to prevent the spread of infection.

Semmelweis's story is a painful demonstration that being right is not enough. Evidence must overcome ego, tradition, and the refusal to accept uncomfortable truths. Error is not evil. Refusing to correct it is. The doctors who refused to wash their hands were not evil. They were wrong and refused to be corrected, and women died because of it.

Biology Stories

These stories are worth remembering. Like the wisdom of the Uncles and the stories of the great physicists, they carry lessons that go beyond the facts.

Darwin's finches and the voyage of the Beagle.

A young naturalist, barely twenty-two, boards a ship for a five-year journey around the world. On a remote volcanic archipelago in the Pacific, he notices that the finches on each island have different beaks. He collects specimens but does not immediately grasp the significance.

Back in England, ornithologist John Gould examines the specimens and tells Darwin they are distinct species, not just varieties. Darwin realizes that the finches descended from a common ancestor and diverged as they adapted to different food sources on different islands.

This insight, combined with twenty more years of evidence-gathering, produces the theory of natural selection: the most powerful idea in biology. It explains why life is diverse, why organisms are adapted to their environments, and why all living things are related.

Darwin hesitated for twenty years, partly from caution, partly from knowing his idea would be controversial. When Wallace independently arrived at the same conclusion, Darwin was forced to publish. On the Origin of Species sold out on its first day.

The lesson: great ideas require both courage and evidence. Darwin had the evidence. Wallace's letter gave him the courage. Together, they changed our understanding of life.

Mendel's peas in the monastery garden.

A quiet monk in Brno tends his garden and crosses pea plants with the patience of a saint. He counts thousands of seeds, recording ratios of round to wrinkled, yellow to green, tall to short. He discovers mathematical patterns in inheritance: 3 to 1 ratios, independent assortment, dominant and recessive traits.

He publishes his findings. Nobody cares. He dies in 1884, his work forgotten. Sixteen years later, three scientists independently rediscover his laws. Mendel becomes the founder of genetics, posthumously.

The lesson: truth does not expire. It does not matter when it is recognized. Mendel's peas told the same story in 1866 as they told in 1900. The universe does not hurry, and neither should the honest researcher.

Fleming's accidental penicillin.

A messy laboratory. A contaminated petri dish. A curious mind that does not throw away the unexpected.

Fleming could have discarded the contaminated plate. Any tidy scientist might have. But he looked at it and asked: why are the bacteria dead around that mold? That question saved millions of lives.

The lesson: accident is the friend of the attentive mind. Discovery does not always come from planning. Sometimes it comes from noticing what you were not looking for. But you can only notice if you are paying attention.

Watson, Crick, and Franklin's DNA.

Three teams racing to solve the structure of life's most important molecule. Franklin's X-ray photographs provided the crucial data. Watson and Crick built the model. The double helix was revealed: a structure so elegant that it immediately suggested how life copies itself.

Franklin did the hardest experimental work. She died young, without recognition. Watson and Crick received the Nobel Prize. History is slowly correcting the record.

The lesson: science is a human enterprise, and humans are imperfect. Credit does not always go where it is deserved. But the truth of the work endures regardless of who receives the prize. Franklin's data was correct whether or not she received recognition for it.

Pasteur disproving spontaneous generation.

For centuries, people believed that life could arise from non-living matter. Maggots appeared on rotting meat, seemingly from nothing. Mice appeared in grain stores.

Francesco Redi showed in 1668 that maggots come from fly eggs, not from the meat itself. He covered meat with gauze: no flies landed, no maggots appeared. But the belief persisted for another two hundred years regarding microbes.

Pasteur settled the question. He boiled broth in flasks with long, curved, swan-like necks. Air could enter but dust and microbes were trapped in the curves. The broth stayed clear for months. When he broke the necks, allowing dust in, the broth clouded with microbes within days.

Life comes from life. It does not arise spontaneously from nothing. Every living thing descends from a previous living thing. The chain of life is unbroken.

The lesson: even deeply held beliefs must submit to experiment. Spontaneous generation seemed obvious to anyone who saw maggots appear on meat. Observation without careful controls leads to wrong conclusions. The scientific method corrects these errors, but only if we let it.

Semmelweis and the cost of ignoring evidence.

A doctor saves lives by insisting on handwashing. His colleagues mock him. He is committed to an asylum. He dies. Decades later, germ theory proves him right.

This is not just a story about handwashing. It is a story about what happens when authority refuses to be corrected by evidence. The doctors who ignored Semmelweis did not intend to kill their patients. They simply could not accept that their own hands were the instruments of death. Pride prevented correction. Women died.

The lesson: the greatest obstacle to truth is not ignorance. It is the illusion of knowledge. The greatest obstacle to correction is not error. It is the refusal to admit error. Semmelweis was right. It did not save him. But eventually, it saved everyone else.

Connections to the Curriculum

DNA and information coding.

You learned in mathematics that binary code uses two symbols, 0 and 1, to represent all information. DNA uses four symbols, A, T, G, and C. Binary is a base-2 code. DNA is a base-4 code, a quaternary code.

The principle is identical: a small set of discrete symbols, arranged in sequence, can encode vast amounts of information. Your computer stores information as sequences of 0s and 1s. Your body stores information as sequences of As, Ts, Gs, and Cs. The substrate is different. The logic is the same.

A gene is like a program: a specific sequence of instructions that produces a specific result. Mutations are like bugs: errors in the code that may have no effect, may cause a crash, or very rarely may improve performance. DNA repair is like error checking: mechanisms that scan for errors and fix them before they cause damage.

In the beginning there was infinite change. From change came difference. From difference came the four bases of DNA, the letters that spell out every living thing.

Evolution and mathematics.

Evolution is mathematics applied to biology. Population growth follows exponential curves, which you learned in mathematics. If a population doubles every generation, it grows as powers of two: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128. Darwin was influenced by Thomas Malthus, who observed that populations grow exponentially while resources grow linearly. The gap between them creates competition, which drives natural selection.

Probability governs mutation. Statistics describes the distribution of traits in a population. Game theory models the evolution of cooperative and competitive strategies. Biology is not separate from mathematics. It is mathematics expressed in chemistry.

The immune system and the scientific method.

The immune system practices the scientific method at the molecular level.

Step one: observe something foreign. An antigen, a molecule the body does not recognize, is detected.

Step two: form a hypothesis. B cells generate antibodies of various shapes, each a guess about how to bind to the invader.

Step three: test the hypothesis. Does the antibody bind? If yes, proceed. If not, try a different shape.

Step four: amplify the successful response. B cells that produce the right antibody multiply rapidly, flooding the body with the solution.

Step five: correct errors. T cells that mistakenly attack the body's own tissues are eliminated during development, a process called self-tolerance.

Step six: store the result in memory. Memory cells persist for years, ready to respond immediately if the same threat returns.

Observe, hypothesize, test, correct, remember. The immune system runs this loop continuously, without conscious thought, with extraordinary precision. The scientific method is not a human invention. It is a pattern that life discovered long before humans existed.

Cooperation, symbiosis, and the Golden Rule.

The passive Golden Rule, taught by Uncle Confucius, says: do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire. The active Golden Rule, taught by Uncle Jesus, says: do to others what you would have them do to you.

Biology shows these principles operating throughout the living world. Mutualism is the Golden Rule in action: the bee pollinates the flower because it benefits the bee, and the flower provides nectar because it benefits the flower. Both give. Both receive. Neither is forced.

Reciprocal altruism in vampire bats is the Silver Rule: cooperate with those who cooperate with you. Refuse cooperation with cheaters. This strategy, called tit-for-tat, has been shown by mathematician Robert Axelrod to be the most successful strategy in repeated interactions. It is simple, fair, and robust.

Parasitism is the violation of these principles: taking without giving, crossing boundaries without consent. Nature responds to parasitism with immune systems, defensive structures, and behavioral avoidance. The biological world enforces the same lesson: voluntary exchange creates mutual benefit. Involuntary taking creates harm and resistance.

Life as organized resistance to entropy.

You learned in physics that the second law of thermodynamics says entropy always increases in a closed system. Order decays. Structures crumble. Information is lost.

Life is the most spectacular exception to this trend, not because it violates the second law, but because it uses energy to create local order. A cell is more ordered than the chemicals it is made from. An organism is more ordered than a cell. An ecosystem is an intricate web of ordered relationships sustained by the continuous flow of energy from the Sun.

The price of this order is constant work. Cells must continuously repair DNA, replace worn-out proteins, fight off invaders, and remove waste. When a cell can no longer maintain itself, it dies. When an organism can no longer maintain itself, it dies. Life requires perpetual error correction, or entropy wins.

This is the deepest connection between physics and biology. The second law demands that things fall apart. Life responds by building systems that put things back together. DNA repair, the immune system, homeostasis, evolution itself: all are error correction mechanisms fighting entropy.

Civilization is the same. A society that stops correcting errors, that silences critics, ignores evidence, or refuses to update its beliefs, is surrendering to entropy. The Lysenko affair, which you learned about in the science corpus, is a perfect example: ideology overruled evidence, error correction was suppressed, and millions starved.

Life itself teaches us that error correction is not optional. It is the price of existence in a universe governed by the second law.

Error is not evil. Refusing to correct it is.

Life is the universe's refusal to stop correcting.

What Comes Next

You have now learned biology: how matter organized itself into living things that grow, reproduce, and fight against entropy. You have seen how DNA encodes information in a four-letter alphabet. You have seen how evolution corrects errors over millions of years. You have seen how cells maintain their boundaries and repair their own damage. You have seen how cooperation creates more complex and resilient forms of life.

Next you will learn economics: how living beings, especially humans, organize resources and trade with each other. Biology shows that even bacteria, bees, and trees trade. They exchange nutrients, services, and information for mutual benefit. Economics formalizes what nature has been doing for billions of years: the voluntary exchange of value between agents.

In biology, organisms that cooperate outcompete organisms that do not. In economics, societies that trade freely outproduce societies that do not. In biology, parasites are fought by immune systems. In economics, parasites are fought by property rights and justice. The patterns are the same because the principles are the same: voluntary exchange creates value, coercion destroys it, and error correction is the mechanism that keeps the system working.

From infinite change came chemistry. From chemistry came the cell. From the cell came every living thing. From living things organizing their cooperation will come the subject of economics.

The method is always the same. Observe. Question. Hypothesize. Test. Correct. Share. Repeat.

Error is not evil. Refusing to correct it is.

Biology is life's refusal to stop correcting.
