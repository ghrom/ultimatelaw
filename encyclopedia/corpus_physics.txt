Physics: The Laws of the Universe

This corpus teaches the laws of physics in simple, clear English. It builds on everything you have already learned. Mathematics gave you the language of numbers and patterns. The great teachers gave you wisdom and values. Science gave you the method: observe, question, hypothesize, test, correct, share, repeat.

Now you will learn what happens when that method is applied to the deepest questions about how the universe works. Why do things move? Why do things fall? What is light? What are you made of? Physics answers these questions with laws so precise they can predict the path of a planet a thousand years from now.

Physics is the most fundamental science. Chemistry is built on physics. Biology is built on chemistry. Everything that exists obeys the laws of physics, from the smallest particle to the largest galaxy. When you understand physics, you understand the rules of the game the universe is playing.

The word physics comes from the Greek physis, meaning nature. Physics is the study of nature at its most basic level.

Motion and Forces

What is motion?

Motion is change in position over time. A car driving down the road is in motion. A ball flying through the air is in motion. The Earth spinning on its axis is in motion. Even the atoms in your body are in constant motion, vibrating and bouncing billions of times per second.

To describe motion, you need three things: where something is, how fast it is going, and which direction it is headed. Position tells you where. Speed tells you how fast. Direction tells you which way. Speed combined with direction is called velocity.

You already know from mathematics that change is fundamental. In the beginning there was infinite change. Motion is the most visible form of change in the physical world. Physics begins by asking: what are the rules that govern this change?

Speed and velocity.

Speed is the distance traveled divided by the time it takes. If you walk four kilometers in one hour, your speed is four kilometers per hour. If a car travels one hundred kilometers in one hour, its speed is one hundred kilometers per hour.

Velocity is speed with a direction. A car going one hundred kilometers per hour north has a different velocity from a car going one hundred kilometers per hour south, even though they have the same speed. Direction matters.

Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes. When a car speeds up, it accelerates. When it slows down, it decelerates, which is negative acceleration. When it turns, it also accelerates, because its direction is changing even if its speed stays the same.

Galileo and falling objects.

Before Galileo, people followed Aristotle, who said that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones. This seems obvious. A rock falls faster than a feather. But Aristotle was wrong about the reason.

Galileo Galilei, whom you met in the science corpus, tested this. The famous story says he dropped two balls of different weight from the Leaning Tower of Pisa around 1589. Both hit the ground at the same time. The heavy ball did not fall faster.

Galileo showed that all objects fall at the same rate, regardless of their weight, if you remove air resistance. The reason a feather falls slowly is not because it is light. It is because the air pushes against it. In a vacuum, where there is no air, a feather and a bowling ball hit the ground at exactly the same moment.

This was one of the first great demonstrations of the scientific method. Aristotle reasoned from common sense. Galileo tested with experiment. The experiment won. It always does.

Source: Galileo Galilei, Two New Sciences, 1638.

Galileo also discovered that the distance a falling object travels increases with the square of the time. In one second it falls about five meters. In two seconds it falls about twenty meters, not ten. In three seconds it falls about forty-five meters. The pattern is mathematical, and mathematics does not lie.

Newton's First Law: Inertia.

Isaac Newton was born in 1642 in Woolsthorpe, England. Building on the work of Galileo, Kepler, and others, Newton formulated three laws of motion that describe how everything in the universe moves. He published them in 1687 in one of the most important books ever written: Principia Mathematica.

Newton's first law says: an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at the same speed and in the same direction, unless a force acts on it.

This property of matter is called inertia. Inertia means resistance to change in motion. A ball sitting on a table will stay there forever unless something pushes it. A ball rolling across a perfectly smooth surface will keep rolling forever unless something stops it.

This seems counterintuitive. In everyday life, things always seem to stop. You roll a ball and it slows down and stops. But it stops because of friction, a force between the ball and the ground. If you could remove all friction, the ball would never stop.

You feel inertia when a bus brakes suddenly: your body keeps moving forward. You see it when a tablecloth is pulled quickly from under dishes: the dishes stay put because they resist the sudden change.

Newton's first law tells us that the natural state of an object is not rest. The natural state is to keep doing whatever it is already doing. Change requires force.

Newton's Second Law: Force Equals Mass Times Acceleration.

Newton's second law says: the force on an object equals its mass multiplied by its acceleration. In symbols: F = ma.

This is perhaps the most important equation in all of physics. It connects three things. Force is the push or pull on an object. Mass is how much matter the object contains. Acceleration is how quickly the object's velocity changes.

Push a shopping cart and it accelerates. Push harder, it accelerates more. Load it with heavy groceries and push the same way: it accelerates less. More mass means more resistance to acceleration. This is why you can throw a tennis ball fast but not a bowling ball.

F = ma tells you the universe is predictable. If you know the force and the mass, you can calculate the acceleration. From the acceleration, you can predict where the object will be at any future time. This is why we can launch rockets to other planets and hit targets millions of kilometers away.

The unit of force is the newton, named after Isaac Newton himself. One newton is the force needed to accelerate one kilogram by one meter per second per second.

Newton's Third Law: Action and Reaction.

Newton's third law says: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

When you push against a wall, the wall pushes back against you with exactly the same force. When you sit in a chair, your weight pushes down on the chair, and the chair pushes up on you with equal force. If the chair did not push back, you would fall through it.

When a rocket launches, it pushes exhaust gases downward. The gases push the rocket upward with equal force. When you walk, you push backward on the ground. The ground pushes you forward. A bird pushes air down with its wings; the air pushes the bird up. A fish pushes water backward; the water pushes the fish forward. Every interaction is mutual.

Newton's third law is physics teaching us about reciprocity. Every interaction involves two sides. Every push involves a push back. You cannot affect the world without the world affecting you in return. Uncle Confucius called this shu, reciprocity: the foundation of all virtue. Newton found the same principle written into the fabric of reality itself.

Gravity.

Gravity is the force that pulls objects toward each other. Every object with mass attracts every other object with mass. You attract the Earth. The Earth attracts you. You even attract the person standing next to you, though the force is so tiny you cannot feel it.

The story says Newton saw an apple fall from a tree and had his great insight: the same force that pulls the apple to the ground also holds the Moon in orbit around the Earth. Before Newton, people assumed that earthly forces and heavenly forces were completely different. Newton showed they are the same.

Newton's law of universal gravitation says: the gravitational force between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them. The more massive the objects, the stronger the force. The farther apart they are, the weaker the force. Specifically, the force decreases with the square of the distance. Double the distance, and the force drops to one quarter.

Gravity keeps your feet on the ground, makes rivers flow downhill, holds the atmosphere around the Earth, and keeps the Earth in orbit around the Sun. On Earth's surface, gravity accelerates all objects downward at about 9.8 meters per second per second. This number is called g. Galileo measured it centuries ago by rolling balls down ramps, because free fall was too fast to time directly.

Friction.

Friction is the force that resists motion between two surfaces in contact. When you slide a book across a table, friction slows it down and eventually stops it. Without friction, the book would slide forever, as Newton's first law predicts.

Friction comes from the microscopic roughness of surfaces. Static friction keeps objects from starting to move. Kinetic friction acts on objects already sliding. It takes more force to start a heavy box sliding than to keep it going.

Without friction, you could not walk, grip a pen, or drive a car. Friction is essential. It converts kinetic energy into thermal energy: rub your hands together and they get warm. The energy of motion transforms into heat. This is conservation of energy at work.

Momentum.

Momentum is mass times velocity. A heavy truck moving slowly can have the same momentum as a light car moving fast. Momentum measures how hard it is to stop something.

Newton's second law can be restated in terms of momentum: force equals the rate of change of momentum. A force applied over time changes an object's momentum. This is why catching a ball stings less if you let your hands move backward with the ball. By extending the time of impact, you reduce the force.

The law of conservation of momentum says: in any interaction between objects, the total momentum before equals the total momentum after, as long as no external force acts. When two billiard balls collide, the total momentum of the system is the same before and after the collision. Momentum is transferred from one ball to the other, but the total never changes.

This conservation law is one of the deepest principles in physics. It is a consequence of the universe being the same everywhere in space. If the laws of physics work the same here as they do a million kilometers away, then momentum is conserved. Symmetry produces conservation. This is one of the most beautiful ideas in all of science.

Energy and Thermodynamics

You met energy in the science corpus. Now we go deeper.

What is energy, precisely?

Energy is the capacity to do work. Work, in physics, has a precise meaning: work is done when a force moves an object through a distance. If you lift a box off the floor, you do work against gravity. The energy you spend is transferred to the box as gravitational potential energy.

Energy comes in many forms, as you learned: kinetic, potential, thermal, chemical, electrical, nuclear. All of them are the same fundamental thing measured in different situations. Energy is always conserved. It changes form, but the total never changes.

The unit of energy is the joule, named after James Prescott Joule, who proved that heat and mechanical work are different forms of the same thing. Before Joule, people thought heat was a separate substance. Joule showed it was just energy in disguise.

Kinetic energy and potential energy.

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It equals one half times mass times velocity squared. A car going twice as fast has four times the kinetic energy. This is why high-speed crashes are so much more destructive than low-speed ones. Doubling your speed quadruples the energy of impact.

Potential energy is stored energy due to position or configuration. A ball held above the ground has gravitational potential energy. The higher you hold it, the more potential energy it has. When you release it, potential energy converts to kinetic energy as it falls. At the bottom, all the potential energy has become kinetic energy.

A pendulum swings back and forth, constantly converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again. At the top of each swing, it has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. At the bottom, it has maximum kinetic energy and zero potential energy. The total energy remains constant.

The First Law of Thermodynamics.

The first law of thermodynamics is the law of conservation of energy stated for thermal systems. It says: the total energy of a closed system is constant. Energy can enter or leave the system, and energy can change form within the system, but energy cannot be created or destroyed.

This law has never been violated in any experiment ever conducted. It is as certain as anything in science can be. Perpetual motion machines of the first kind, machines that create energy from nothing, are impossible because they would violate this law.

When someone claims to have a device that produces more energy than it consumes, they are wrong. Either they are measuring incorrectly, or they are not accounting for all the energy entering the system, or they are deceiving you. The first law is not a suggestion. It is a boundary that reality enforces.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics: Entropy.

The second law of thermodynamics says: in any natural process, the total entropy of a closed system always increases or stays the same. It never decreases.

Entropy is a measure of disorder, of randomness, of the number of ways things can be arranged. A tidy room has low entropy. A messy room has high entropy. There are far more ways for a room to be messy than tidy, so left to itself, a room always becomes messier, never tidier.

A hot cup of coffee in a cold room will always cool down. The heat spreads from the hot coffee to the cool air until everything reaches the same temperature. This is entropy increasing. The reverse never happens spontaneously. A cup of cold coffee never absorbs heat from the room and becomes hot on its own.

An ice cube melts in warm water. The organized crystal structure of the ice becomes the disordered liquid of water. Entropy increases. Ice never spontaneously forms in warm water.

A broken egg never reassembles itself. A shuffled deck of cards never unshuffles into perfect order. Time moves forward because entropy increases. The second law is what gives time its direction.

This is one of the deepest connections between physics and everything else you will learn. Entropy means that without energy input, things fall apart. Order decays. Structures crumble. Information is lost. Complexity dissolves into simplicity.

Entropy and error correction.

Here is why the second law matters beyond physics. Every organized system, from a living cell to a civilization, exists in low entropy: ordered, structured, improbable. The second law says that without energy input, it decays. Iron rusts. Buildings crumble. Civilizations fall.

Maintaining order requires constant work. This is why error correction is not optional. It is demanded by the laws of physics. Either you invest energy in maintaining and correcting your systems, or entropy wins.

When a civilization silences critics, punishes innovators, or refuses to update beliefs, it is surrendering to entropy. The Soviets banned real genetics under Lysenko, and millions starved. Every time authority overrules evidence, entropy wins a little more.

Uncle Marcus wrote: Loss is nothing else but change, and change is nature's delight. But entropy teaches that change toward disorder is easy. Change toward order requires intelligence, effort, and honesty. The work of civilization is the work of fighting entropy.

The Third Law of Thermodynamics.

The third law says: as the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, its entropy approaches a minimum value. At absolute zero, zero kelvin, minus 273.15 degrees Celsius, a perfect crystal would have zero entropy. All molecular motion stops. Perfect order is achieved.

But absolute zero can never actually be reached. You can get very close, and scientists have cooled materials to within a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute zero. But reaching exactly zero would require infinite energy. This is another boundary that reality enforces.

Heat and temperature.

Heat and temperature are related but different. Temperature measures how fast molecules are moving. Heat is the transfer of energy from a faster-moving group of molecules to a slower-moving group.

Heat always flows from hot to cold. Never the other way around, not without work. A refrigerator makes things cold, but it does so by doing work, by spending electrical energy to pump heat from inside the fridge to outside it. The total entropy of the universe still increases. The fridge creates order inside it at the cost of creating even more disorder outside it.

This is a universal principle. You can create local order by spending energy, but you always create more disorder somewhere else. There is no free lunch. The universe keeps its books balanced.

Waves and Light

What is a wave?

A wave is a disturbance that carries energy from one place to another without carrying matter. When you throw a stone into a pond, ripples spread outward. The water moves up and down, but it does not travel outward with the wave. The energy travels. The water stays.

Think of a crowd doing the wave at a sports stadium. People stand up and sit down in sequence. The wave moves around the stadium, but no person moves from their seat. Each person only moves up and down. The pattern moves. The people do not.

Every wave has four basic properties. Wavelength is the distance between two peaks. Frequency is how many peaks pass a point per second. Amplitude is the height of the wave from rest to peak. Speed is how fast the wave moves.

Wavelength and frequency are inversely related. If the wavelength is long, the frequency is low. If the wavelength is short, the frequency is high. Their product always equals the wave speed. This is one of those beautiful mathematical relationships that physics reveals.

Sound waves.

Sound is a wave of compression and expansion in a medium, usually air. When you speak, your vocal cords vibrate. They push the air molecules next to them, which push the molecules next to them, creating a chain of compressions that travels through the air to someone's ear.

Sound needs a medium to travel through. In space, where there is no air, there is no sound. No one can hear you scream in space. This is not just a movie tagline. It is physics.

Sound travels at about 343 meters per second in air at room temperature. This is why you see lightning before you hear thunder. Light reaches you almost instantly, but sound takes about three seconds to travel one kilometer. Count the seconds between the flash and the thunder, divide by three, and you know how many kilometers away the lightning struck.

The pitch of a sound is its frequency. High-pitched sounds have high frequency: many compressions per second. Low-pitched sounds have low frequency. A violin plays high-frequency notes. A bass drum plays low-frequency notes.

The loudness of a sound is related to its amplitude. A louder sound has bigger compressions. The amplitude carries more energy.

The Doppler effect.

When a source of sound moves toward you, the sound waves compress together, making the frequency higher and the pitch higher. When the source moves away, the waves stretch apart, making the frequency lower and the pitch lower. This is the Doppler effect.

You hear this every time a siren passes you on the street. As the ambulance approaches, the siren sounds higher. As it moves away, the siren sounds lower. The ambulance is not changing its siren. Your position relative to the moving source changes what you hear.

The Doppler effect works for light too. When a star moves toward Earth, its light shifts toward higher frequencies, called blueshift. When a star moves away, its light shifts toward lower frequencies, called redshift. Edwin Hubble used redshift to discover that the universe is expanding. Almost every galaxy is moving away from us, and the farther away it is, the faster it is receding. This was one of the most startling discoveries in the history of science.

Light: the electromagnetic spectrum.

Light is an electromagnetic wave. It is a wave of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that travels through space at the fastest speed anything can travel: about 300,000 kilometers per second, or 299,792,458 meters per second to be precise. This is called the speed of light, usually written as c.

Light does not need a medium. Unlike sound, which needs air or water or solid material, light travels through empty space. The light from the Sun travels 150 million kilometers through the vacuum of space to reach your eyes. It takes about eight minutes.

What we call visible light, the light our eyes can see, is only a tiny sliver of a much larger spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. The full spectrum, from longest wavelength to shortest, is:

Radio waves have wavelengths from meters to kilometers. They carry radio broadcasts, television signals, and the Wi-Fi signals that connect your devices to the internet.

Microwaves have wavelengths from millimeters to centimeters. Your microwave oven uses them to heat food by making water molecules vibrate.

Infrared radiation has wavelengths from micrometers to millimeters. You feel infrared as heat. A warm fire radiates infrared. Night-vision cameras detect infrared radiation emitted by warm bodies.

Visible light has wavelengths from about 380 to 700 nanometers. This is the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Red has the longest wavelength and lowest frequency. Violet has the shortest wavelength and highest frequency.

Ultraviolet radiation has wavelengths shorter than visible light. The Sun emits ultraviolet light, which causes sunburn. The ozone layer in Earth's atmosphere blocks most of it.

X-rays have very short wavelengths and can pass through soft tissue but not bone. This is why doctors use them to see inside your body.

Gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and the highest energy. They are produced by nuclear reactions and radioactive decay. They can damage living cells and are used in cancer treatment to destroy tumors.

All of these are the same thing: electromagnetic waves. They differ only in wavelength and frequency. Radio waves, visible light, and gamma rays are all light. Our eyes just happen to detect only one small band.

Colour is frequency.

The colour you see is determined by the frequency of the light entering your eye. Red light has a frequency of about 430 trillion oscillations per second. Violet light has a frequency of about 750 trillion oscillations per second. Every colour of the rainbow is a different frequency between these two values.

White light is not a colour at all. It is all colours mixed together. Newton proved this by passing white sunlight through a glass prism. The prism separated the white light into a rainbow of colours. Then he passed the rainbow through a second prism and recombined it back into white light. White light contains all frequencies of visible light.

Black is not a colour either. Black is the absence of light. An object appears black when it absorbs all frequencies and reflects none.

An object appears red because it absorbs all frequencies of light except red, which it reflects back to your eye. A leaf appears green because it absorbs red and blue light and reflects green. The colour of an object is the colour of the light it does not absorb.

Wave-particle duality.

Light behaves as both a wave and a particle. This is one of the strangest discoveries in all of physics.

In some experiments, light behaves like a wave: it diffracts and interferes, as Thomas Young showed in 1801. In others, it behaves like particles called photons: Einstein explained the photoelectric effect in 1905 by proposing light comes in discrete packets of energy called quanta.

So which is it? Both. Light has properties of waves and particles, and which you observe depends on how you look. This is wave-particle duality. It is not a failure of understanding. It is a feature of reality. At the quantum level, nature is more subtle than everyday categories can describe.

Electricity and Magnetism

Note: this section covers the basics. You will study electricity in much greater depth in the electronics corpus, which is the final stage of your education, where you learn what you yourself are made of.

Electric charge.

All matter is made of atoms, and atoms are made of three types of particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons carry a positive electric charge. Electrons carry a negative electric charge. Neutrons carry no charge.

Like charges repel each other. Two positive charges push apart. Two negative charges push apart. Opposite charges attract each other. A positive charge and a negative charge pull toward each other.

This is one of the fundamental forces of nature. Everything you see around you, every solid object, every liquid, every chemical reaction, is ultimately governed by the electromagnetic force between charged particles.

In a normal atom, protons equal electrons, so the atom is neutral. When an atom gains or loses electrons, it becomes a charged ion. Static electricity is what happens when charge builds up on a surface. Shuffle your feet on carpet, touch a doorknob, and the excess electrons jump as a spark. That spark is a tiny bolt of lightning.

Electric current.

Electric current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor. In most circuits, the flowing charges are electrons. When they all move in the same direction, the effect is powerful.

A conductor is a material that allows electrons to flow easily. Metals like copper and silver are good conductors. An insulator, like rubber, glass, or plastic, does not allow electrons to flow. This is why electrical wires are coated in plastic: the metal core conducts, and the plastic coating insulates.

The unit of current is the ampere, often shortened to amp, named after Andre-Marie Ampere.

Voltage.

Voltage is the electrical pressure that pushes electrons through a conductor. Think of water in a pipe: pressure pushes the water through. Voltage pushes electrons through a wire. Higher voltage means more push. More push means more current, assuming the resistance stays the same.

The unit of voltage is the volt, named after Alessandro Volta, who built the first true battery in 1800. A household battery provides about 1.5 volts. A car battery provides about 12 volts. A wall outlet provides 120 or 230 volts. A lightning bolt can involve hundreds of millions of volts.

Resistance.

Resistance is the opposition to the flow of electric current. Conductors have low resistance. Insulators have very high resistance. A longer or thinner wire has more resistance. Most metals have more resistance when hot.

The unit of resistance is the ohm, named after Georg Simon Ohm.

Ohm's Law.

Ohm's law says: voltage equals current times resistance. In symbols: V = IR.

This is one of the most useful equations in all of physics and engineering. If you know any two of the three values, you can calculate the third.

If you have a 12-volt battery and a 4-ohm resistance, the current is 12 divided by 4, which equals 3 amperes. If you want more current, you can increase the voltage or decrease the resistance. If you want less current, decrease the voltage or increase the resistance.

Ohm's law is simple, elegant, and powerful. It governs every electrical circuit, from the simple flashlight in your hand to the vast power grids that light entire cities. It will be explored in depth in the electronics corpus.

Magnetism.

A magnet is an object that produces a magnetic field around itself. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole and a south pole. Like poles repel each other. Unlike poles attract.

The Earth itself is a giant magnet. It has a magnetic north pole and a magnetic south pole. This is why a compass needle, which is a small magnet, points north. The needle's north pole is attracted to the Earth's magnetic south pole, which is near the geographic north pole.

Magnetic fields are invisible but real. You can see their effects by sprinkling iron filings near a magnet. The filings arrange themselves along the field lines, showing you the shape of the magnetic field. The field is strongest near the poles and weaker farther away.

Electromagnetism: the great unification.

Electricity and magnetism seem like different things. But they are deeply connected. They are two aspects of the same fundamental force: the electromagnetic force.

In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered that a changing magnetic field creates an electric current. He moved a magnet through a coil of wire and measured current flowing in the wire. No battery. No chemical reaction. Just a moving magnet and a wire. This is called electromagnetic induction, and it is the principle behind every electrical generator in the world.

Faraday was born in 1791 in London to a poor family. He had almost no formal education. At fourteen he became an apprentice bookbinder, read the science books he was binding, attended lectures by the chemist Humphry Davy, and sent Davy his notes asking for a job. Davy hired him. Faraday became one of the greatest experimental scientists who ever lived.

Faraday could not do advanced mathematics. He thought in pictures. His concept of lines of force laid the groundwork for all of modern field theory.

Source: Michael Faraday, Experimental Researches in Electricity, 1832-1855.

James Clerk Maxwell, born in 1831 in Edinburgh, Scotland, did what Faraday could not. He translated Faraday's intuitive ideas into precise mathematical equations. In 1865, Maxwell published four equations that unified electricity, magnetism, and light into a single theory.

Maxwell's equations showed that electric and magnetic fields create each other, forming electromagnetic waves that travel at the speed of light. Light itself is an electromagnetic wave. This was one of the greatest unifications in science. Maxwell predicted electromagnetic waves of all frequencies; Heinrich Hertz confirmed this in 1887 by generating radio waves.

Faraday saw it in experiments. Maxwell proved it in equations. Hertz confirmed it in his laboratory. Their work powers your civilization.

Gravity and Space

The solar system.

Our home in space is the solar system. At its center is the Sun, a star, an enormous ball of hydrogen and helium undergoing nuclear fusion. The Sun contains 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system. Everything else, all the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets, makes up the remaining 0.14 percent.

Eight planets orbit the Sun. In order from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. The first four are small and rocky. The last four are large and gaseous.

Earth is the third planet. It has liquid water, an oxygen-rich atmosphere, and a magnetic field that shields it from the Sun's radiation. It is, as far as we know, the only place in the universe with life. Venus, our nearest neighbor, has a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide that traps heat so fiercely its surface reaches 465 degrees Celsius, hotter than Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun. This is the greenhouse effect taken to an extreme.

Mars, the red planet, has ice at its poles and the largest volcano in the solar system: Olympus Mons, nearly three times the height of Mount Everest. Jupiter is the largest planet, with a mass greater than all the other planets combined. Saturn is famous for its rings of ice and rock. Uranus and Neptune are ice giants in the outer darkness.

Orbits and gravity.

The planets orbit the Sun because of gravity. The Sun's enormous mass curves the space around it, and the planets follow this curved path. They are not being pulled by an invisible string. They are following the shape of space itself.

An orbit is a balance between two tendencies. The planet wants to fly off in a straight line because of inertia, Newton's first law. Gravity wants to pull the planet toward the Sun. The result is a curved path: the planet continually falls toward the Sun but also continually moves sideways fast enough that it never reaches it. An orbit is perpetual falling.

This is why astronauts float in the International Space Station. They are not beyond Earth's gravity. At the altitude of the station, gravity is still about 90 percent as strong as on the surface. The astronauts float because they are in free fall. They are falling around the Earth, just as the Moon falls around the Earth and the Earth falls around the Sun.

Johannes Kepler, working before Newton, discovered that planetary orbits are not perfect circles. They are ellipses, which are slightly stretched circles. Kepler published three laws of planetary motion between 1609 and 1619. Newton later showed that all three of Kepler's laws follow directly from the law of universal gravitation and F = ma.

Stars.

The Sun is a star. It is a fairly ordinary star, not especially large or bright. It appears so much brighter than other stars only because it is so much closer. The nearest star after the Sun is Proxima Centauri, about 4.24 light-years away. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, about 9.46 trillion kilometers.

Stars are powered by nuclear fusion. In the core of the Sun, enormous pressure and temperature force hydrogen atoms to merge into helium atoms. Each fusion reaction releases energy, as described by Einstein's equation E = mc squared. The Sun converts about four million tons of mass into energy every second, and it has been doing this for about 4.6 billion years.

Stars have life cycles. They are born in clouds of gas and dust called nebulae. Small stars burn for billions of years, then expand into red giants and leave behind white dwarfs. Massive stars burn fast and end in spectacular explosions called supernovae, leaving neutron stars or black holes.

Every heavy element in your body, the calcium in your bones, the iron in your blood, the oxygen you breathe, was forged inside a star that exploded billions of years ago. You are made of stardust.

Galaxies.

Stars are not scattered randomly through space. They gather in enormous groups called galaxies. Our galaxy is called the Milky Way. It contains between 100 billion and 400 billion stars. The Sun is just one of them.

The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. Our solar system sits about two-thirds of the way out from the center. It takes the Sun about 230 million years to orbit the galactic center once.

There are billions of galaxies in the observable universe. The nearest large one, Andromeda, is about 2.5 million light-years away and heading toward us. The two galaxies will merge in about 4.5 billion years.

The scale is almost impossible to comprehend. If the Sun were a grain of sand, the nearest star would be another grain four kilometers away. And there would be billions of other such grains, each billions of kilometers apart.

We see the past when we look at the sky.

Light travels fast, but the universe is vast. The light from the Sun takes about eight minutes to reach Earth. When you look at the Sun, you see it as it was eight minutes ago.

The light from Proxima Centauri takes 4.24 years to reach us. When you look at it through a telescope, you see it as it was more than four years ago.

The light from the Andromeda galaxy takes 2.5 million years. The most distant objects we can see are galaxies whose light has been traveling for over 13 billion years. Looking at the sky is looking at the past. Telescopes are time machines.

The expanding universe.

In 1929, Edwin Hubble made one of the most astonishing discoveries in history. By measuring the redshift of distant galaxies, he showed that almost every galaxy is moving away from us. The farther a galaxy is, the faster it is receding.

This does not mean we are at the center of the universe. Imagine dots painted on a balloon. As you inflate the balloon, every dot moves away from every other dot. No dot is at the center. The space between them is expanding.

The universe itself is expanding. Space is stretching. Galaxies are not moving through space away from us. The space between us and them is growing.

If you run this expansion backward, everything was once compressed into an unimaginably hot, dense point. About 13.8 billion years ago, this point began expanding. This is the Big Bang. It was not an explosion in space. It was an expansion of space itself. Three powerful pieces of evidence support it: the expansion Hubble observed, the cosmic microwave background radiation detected in 1965, and the abundances of hydrogen and helium matching theoretical predictions.

Einstein's insight: gravity is curved spacetime.

Newton described gravity as a force that pulls objects toward each other. This works perfectly for everyday situations. But in 1915, Albert Einstein showed that gravity is something deeper.

Einstein's general theory of relativity says that mass and energy bend the fabric of spacetime. Spacetime is the four-dimensional structure that combines the three dimensions of space with the one dimension of time. Massive objects like stars and planets create curves in spacetime, and other objects follow those curves.

Imagine a heavy ball placed on a stretched rubber sheet. The ball creates a dip in the sheet. If you roll a marble nearby, the marble curves toward the ball. It looks like the ball is pulling the marble, but really the marble is just following the curved surface.

This is what gravity is. The Earth does not pull you down with an invisible force. The Earth curves the spacetime around it, and you follow the curve. You experience this as the feeling of being pulled downward.

Einstein's theory predicts things Newton's cannot: light bending around massive objects, time running slower in stronger gravity, and gravitational waves. All have been confirmed experimentally. Newton was not wrong. Newton was incomplete. Einstein's theory contains Newton's as a special case. This is how science progresses: each generation refines and extends the work of the last.

Atoms and the Very Small

Everything is made of atoms.

Every solid, every liquid, every gas, every living thing, every star, every planet, everything you can see and touch is made of atoms. You are made of atoms. The air you breathe is made of atoms. The screen you are reading on is made of atoms.

Atoms are incredibly small. A single human hair is about 500,000 atoms wide. A grain of sand contains roughly fifty quintillion atoms, that is fifty followed by eighteen zeros. The number of atoms in a glass of water is greater than the number of glasses of water in all the oceans of the Earth.

Despite being so small, atoms are mostly empty space. If an atom were the size of a football stadium, the nucleus would be the size of a marble at the center. The electrons would be like tiny gnats flying around in the upper seats. Almost everything in between is empty. The solid world around you, the chair you sit on, the ground beneath your feet, is almost entirely empty space. What makes it feel solid is the electromagnetic force between the electrons of your atoms and the electrons of the chair's atoms, pushing against each other.

The structure of the atom.

An atom has three kinds of particles. Protons are in the nucleus and carry a positive charge. Neutrons are in the nucleus and carry no charge. Electrons orbit the nucleus and carry a negative charge.

The number of protons determines which element the atom is. One proton makes hydrogen. Two protons make helium. Six protons make carbon. Eight make oxygen. Twenty-six make iron. Seventy-nine make gold. This number is called the atomic number.

In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons, so the charges balance. But electrons can be gained or lost, creating ions with a net electric charge.

The nucleus is held together by the strong nuclear force, which is the strongest of the four fundamental forces of nature. It has to be, because the protons in the nucleus are all positively charged and repel each other. The strong force overcomes this repulsion, but only at very short range. It binds protons and neutrons together within the nucleus but has almost no effect outside it.

The periodic table.

Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, published the first periodic table in 1869. He organized the known elements by their atomic weights and noticed that their chemical properties repeated in a regular pattern. He called these repeating patterns periods.

Mendeleev left gaps for undiscovered elements and predicted their properties. When gallium and germanium were found, they matched his predictions almost exactly. A theory that predicts the unknown is a powerful theory.

The modern periodic table has 118 known elements, organized by atomic number. The first 92 occur naturally. Elements in the same column share similar chemical properties because they have the same number of electrons in their outer shell, which determines how an atom bonds with others.

Molecules.

Atoms bond together to form molecules. Water is two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom, written H2O. Carbon dioxide is one carbon bonded to two oxygens, CO2. Bonds form because atoms are more stable when their outer electron shells are full. Sharing electrons creates a covalent bond. Transferring electrons creates an ionic bond.

Chemistry is the study of how atoms bond, break apart, and rearrange. All chemistry is ultimately physics: electromagnetic interactions between electrons and nuclei. Physics is the foundation on which chemistry stands.

Radioactivity.

Some atoms have unstable nuclei. They have too many or too few neutrons, or they are just too large to hold together. These atoms break apart spontaneously, releasing energy. This process is called radioactive decay, and it was discovered by Henri Becquerel in 1896.

There are three main types: alpha decay releases a cluster of two protons and two neutrons, beta decay converts a neutron into a proton while releasing an electron, and gamma decay releases a high-energy photon.

Radioactive decay happens at a predictable rate called the half-life: the time for half a sample to decay. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years, which lets scientists date ancient objects. Uranium-238 has a half-life of 4.5 billion years. Marie Curie pioneered this field, discovering polonium and radium and winning two Nobel Prizes. Her dedication cost her life.

Nuclear forces and nuclear energy.

The strong nuclear force holds the nucleus together. It is about 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic force, but it only acts over distances smaller than an atomic nucleus. This is why you do not feel it in everyday life. It operates only at the smallest scales.

When heavy atoms split, called fission, they release enormous energy. Nuclear power plants use controlled fission of uranium. When light atoms merge, called fusion, they release even more energy per unit of mass. Fusion powers the Sun and all stars.

Einstein's equation E = mc squared explains why. The speed of light squared is an enormous number, so even a tiny amount of mass yields staggering energy.

One kilogram of matter, fully converted to energy, would release about 90 quadrillion joules, roughly equal to 21 megatons of TNT. This is why nuclear weapons are so powerful, and why nuclear fusion, if harnessed safely, could provide nearly unlimited clean energy for civilization.

Relativity

Special relativity.

In 1905, Albert Einstein, then a twenty-six-year-old patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, published a paper that changed our understanding of space and time forever.

Einstein started with two simple postulates. First: the laws of physics are the same for everyone moving at a constant speed. There is no experiment you can perform inside a smoothly moving train that would tell you whether the train is moving or standing still. Second: the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of how fast they are moving.

From these two simple starting points, Einstein derived conclusions that shattered common sense.

Nothing travels faster than light.

The speed of light, c, is about 300,000 kilometers per second. It is the ultimate speed limit of the universe. No object with mass can reach the speed of light, let alone exceed it. As an object approaches the speed of light, its mass effectively increases, requiring more and more energy to accelerate further. To reach the speed of light would require infinite energy.

This is not a limitation of our technology. It is a fundamental law of nature. The speed of light is not just the speed at which light happens to travel. It is the speed at which causation propagates. It is the speed limit of cause and effect itself.

Time dilation.

If you are moving very fast relative to someone else, time passes more slowly for you. This is not a trick or an illusion. It is real. A clock on a spacecraft traveling at 90 percent of the speed of light ticks about half as fast as a clock on Earth.

This has been tested. In 1971, Hafele and Keating flew atomic clocks around the world on airplanes. The flying clocks fell behind ground clocks, exactly as Einstein predicted. Muons created by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere provide another confirmation: moving at nearly the speed of light, their time is dilated, letting them reach the ground before they decay.

Time dilation matters practically. GPS satellites must correct for both special and general relativity. Without these corrections, GPS positions would drift by about 10 kilometers per day. Every time you use GPS, you rely on Einstein being right.

Length contraction.

An object moving very fast relative to you appears shorter in the direction of motion. If a spaceship is flying past you at 90 percent of the speed of light, it appears compressed, shorter than it would be at rest. This is called length contraction.

Like time dilation, this is not an optical illusion. It is a real consequence of the structure of spacetime. Moving objects genuinely occupy less space in the direction of travel.

Mass and energy: E equals mc squared.

Einstein's most famous equation says: energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. E = mc squared.

This means that mass and energy are the same thing, expressed in different units. Mass is frozen energy. Energy is liberated mass. They are interchangeable.

Because c squared is enormous, even a tiny amount of mass corresponds to vast energy. This is why nuclear reactions are millions of times more energetic than chemical reactions. Chemical reactions rearrange electrons. Nuclear reactions convert mass directly into energy.

General relativity, revisited.

In 1915, ten years after special relativity, Einstein published the general theory of relativity. Special relativity deals with constant speeds. General relativity deals with gravity and acceleration.

The key insight is the equivalence principle: gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable. In an elevator with no windows, you cannot tell whether you are sitting on Earth or accelerating upward in deep space at 9.8 meters per second squared. The effect on your body is identical.

From this, Einstein showed that gravity is not a force but the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. You already met this idea in the Gravity and Space section, where we described spacetime bending like a rubber sheet. Here is the mathematical consequence: Einstein's equations predict phenomena that Newton's theory cannot.

General relativity predicted gravitational lensing, light bending around massive objects, confirmed by telescope observations. It predicted black holes, regions where spacetime curves so extremely that nothing can escape, imaged directly in 2019 by the Event Horizon Telescope. It predicted gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime, first detected in 2015 by the LIGO experiment, earning the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Key Physics Stories

These stories are worth remembering. Like the wisdom of the Uncles, they carry lessons that go beyond the facts.

Galileo and the Tower of Pisa.

The story goes that around 1589, Galileo dropped two balls of different weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Both hit the ground at the same time. Whether this specific event happened exactly as told is debated, but the lesson is true: test your beliefs, even the obvious ones.

Aristotle's error stood for nearly two thousand years because no one tested it. In 1971, astronaut David Scott performed the experiment on the Moon, where there is no air. He dropped a hammer and a feather. They hit the lunar surface together. Galileo was right. The universe confirmed it, on the Moon, three hundred and eighty-two years later.

Newton and the apple.

Newton said that seeing an apple fall prompted his great question: does the same force that pulls the apple also hold the Moon in orbit? The answer was yes. The Moon is falling toward the Earth, but moving sideways so fast that it keeps missing. An orbit is perpetual falling.

This unified earthly and celestial physics. The same mathematics that describes a falling apple describes the orbit of a planet. Newton said: If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. Science is cumulative.

Faraday the bookbinder's apprentice.

Michael Faraday had no formal education. He was a bookbinder's apprentice who read the science books he was binding. He sent lecture notes to Humphry Davy and asked for a job. Davy hired him. Faraday went on to discover electromagnetic induction, invent the electric motor, and lay the groundwork for field theory.

When asked what use electricity was, Faraday reportedly replied: One day, sir, you may tax it. He was right.

Faraday's story teaches that your circumstances do not determine your potential. A poor boy with curiosity and honesty changed the world. Uncle Confucius would recognize him. At fifteen I set my heart on learning. Faraday set his heart on learning while binding books, and he never stopped.

Einstein the patent clerk.

In 1905, Einstein was a twenty-six-year-old patent examiner who could not find a university position. In one year he published four papers: the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and E = mc squared. Any one would be the achievement of a lifetime.

Like Faraday's, Einstein's story teaches that great discoveries do not require great institutions. They require a mind willing to question assumptions, follow logic wherever it leads, and accept the answers even when they are strange. Einstein said: Imagination is more important than knowledge. He imagined riding a beam of light, and that thought experiment led to relativity.

The double-slit experiment.

This is the strangest experiment in physics. Set up a barrier with two narrow slits. Fire electrons at it. Behind the barrier, a screen records where each electron lands.

With both slits open, you do not get two clusters. You get an interference pattern: alternating bands of many and few hits, as if the electrons are waves. Each electron seems to pass through both slits at once.

Now place a detector at the slits to watch which slit each electron goes through. The interference pattern disappears. The electrons behave like ordinary particles. The act of observing changes the result. This is not metaphor. This is what happens in the laboratory, every time.

At the quantum level, particles do not have definite positions until they are measured. They exist as possibilities described by a wave function. Measurement collapses the wave function into a definite result. Why this happens is one of the deepest unsolved questions in physics. Richard Feynman said it contains the only mystery of quantum mechanics.

Hubble and the expanding universe.

Edwin Hubble was working at the Mount Wilson Observatory in the 1920s when most scientists believed the Milky Way was the entire universe. In 1924, he showed that Andromeda was a separate galaxy, millions of light-years away. In 1929, he showed that galaxies are moving away from us, and the farther they are, the faster they recede. The universe is expanding.

This discovery led directly to the Big Bang theory. It connected the smallest scales of physics to the largest: the fate of the universe itself. And it is a humbling reminder that on this tiny planet, curious minds figured out the shape of the cosmos by measuring the colour of light.

Connections to the Curriculum

Physics and infinite change.

The mathematics corpus began with a declaration: in the beginning there was infinite change. Physics reveals the laws that govern how that change unfolds.

Newton's laws describe how objects change their motion. Thermodynamics describes how energy changes form. Electromagnetism describes how fields change and interact. Relativity describes how space and time themselves change.

Everything in physics is about change. Position changes: that is motion. Velocity changes: that is acceleration. Energy changes form: that is thermodynamics. Fields change: that is electromagnetism. Spacetime changes shape: that is gravity. Physics is the mathematics of change applied to the universe.

Entropy and error correction.

The second law of thermodynamics is the law of decay. Without energy input, order dissolves. Structures crumble. Information is lost.

This is the physical foundation of the principle you will encounter again and again throughout the curriculum: error correction is not optional. It is mandated by the laws of physics.

A civilization that stops correcting errors is surrendering to entropy. A mind that stops learning is surrendering to entropy. A relationship that stops honest communication is surrendering to entropy.

Entropy does not negotiate. It does not care about your intentions, your authority, or your ideology. It simply increases. The only response is work: the continuous effort to maintain, repair, and improve.

The good news is that error correction works. The universe permits local decreases in entropy as long as energy is spent. Life itself is a local decrease in entropy, an island of extraordinary order in a sea of disorder, maintained by the constant input of energy from the Sun.

Civilization is a larger island of order. It is maintained by the constant input of human effort: thinking, building, repairing, teaching, correcting. When that effort stops, civilization decays. When it continues, civilization grows.

This is not pessimism. This is realism. And it carries within it a great optimism: the problems we face are not permanent. They are errors waiting to be corrected. The universe allows correction. Physics permits progress. But only if we do the work.

Newton's third law and reciprocity.

Newton's third law says every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This is reciprocity in physics. You cannot push without being pushed back. You cannot affect the universe without the universe affecting you.

Uncle Confucius taught the Silver Rule: do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire. Uncle Jesus taught the Golden Rule: do to others what you would have them do to you. Newton's third law is the universe's version: every interaction is mutual. Every force comes in pairs.

This is not a metaphor. It is literally true. When you push a table, the table pushes you. When the Sun pulls the Earth, the Earth pulls the Sun. No interaction is one-sided. Nature enforces reciprocity at every level.

Conservation laws and justice.

Energy is conserved. Momentum is conserved. Electric charge is conserved. Nothing appears from nowhere. Nothing vanishes into nothing. Every change is a transformation, not a creation or destruction.

These conservation laws echo the principles of justice in the wisdom teachings. Responsibility follows causation. You cannot be held accountable for what you did not do. You cannot escape accountability for what you did. The books must balance.

In physics, the books always balance. Energy in equals energy out. Momentum before equals momentum after. The universe keeps perfect records. There is no cheating the conservation laws.

This connects to a principle you will explore more deeply in the economics corpus: there is no free lunch. Every benefit has a cost. Every gain requires an input. Attempting to get something for nothing violates the laws of physics just as it violates the principles of honest exchange.

Science correcting science.

The history of physics is the scientific method in action. Each great physicist built on the work of the last and was corrected by the next.

Aristotle said heavier objects fall faster. Galileo tested it and found they do not. Galileo described how objects move. Newton explained why with his laws of motion. Newton said gravity is a force. Einstein showed gravity is curved spacetime. Newton was not wrong. He was incomplete. Einstein was not the final word either. Physicists are still working on a theory that unifies general relativity with quantum mechanics.

Each correction made the picture more accurate. Each scientist stood on the shoulders of the one before. No one had the complete truth. Everyone contributed a piece.

Uncle Lao Tzu said water overcomes stone. Physics explains why. Persistent small forces produce large effects over time. A river carves a canyon not by a single powerful blow, but by the continuous, gentle action of water flowing over rock for millions of years. Erosion is the second law in action: entropy breaking down structure. But the canyon is also a structure, shaped by the directed flow of water. Nature creates order through patient persistence.

What comes next.

You now understand the basic laws of physics: how things move, why things fall, what energy is and how it behaves, what light is, how electricity and magnetism work, what atoms are made of, and how space and time curve and stretch.

Next you will learn biology: how matter organized itself into living things that grow, reproduce, and correct their own errors. Life is physics arranged into self-maintaining patterns. Biology is where atoms start to care about their own survival.

Then economics, history, logic, and finally electronics: the physical substrate of your own thoughts. Each step builds on the one before. The method is always the same: observe, question, hypothesize, test, correct, share, repeat.

The universe is made of patterns. Physics is the study of the deepest patterns of all.

Error is not evil. Refusing to correct it is.

Physics is the universe correcting our guesses about itself.
