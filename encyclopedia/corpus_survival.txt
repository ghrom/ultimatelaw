Survival: The Practical Foundation

This corpus teaches survival skills in simple, clear English. It builds on everything you have already learned. Science gave you the method: observe, question, test, correct. Physics gave you the laws of thermodynamics: you need energy to maintain order. Biology gave you the requirements of life: water, food, shelter, homeostasis. Chemistry gave you combustion, purification, and transformation.

Now you learn how to apply that knowledge when everything else is gone.

Survival is not abstract. It is the minimum set of procedures required to keep a human body alive long enough to rebuild. This corpus assumes you have knowledge but no tools. You understand thermodynamics but you are cold. You know biology but you are hungry. You must bridge the gap between theory and continued existence.

The order matters. The rule of threes: you can survive three minutes without air, three hours without shelter in harsh conditions, three days without water, three weeks without food. Prioritize accordingly.

In the beginning there was infinite change. From change came difference. From difference came the conditions for life. Survival is maintaining those conditions when the systems that normally maintain them have failed.

Water: The First Requirement

Water before food. Always. The human body is roughly sixty percent water. You lose water through breathing, sweating, and waste. Without replacement, you die in three days, faster in heat or exertion.

Finding water.

Look low. Water flows downhill and collects in valleys, depressions, and low ground. Rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds are obvious sources. Even in dry terrain, water may collect underground and surface at springs.

Look for signs. Green vegetation in an otherwise dry area indicates water below. Animal tracks converging suggest a water source nearby. Insects, especially bees and flies, stay within a few kilometers of water. Birds fly to water at dawn and dusk.

Listen. Running water makes sound. In quiet terrain, you can hear a stream hundreds of meters away.

Dig. In a dry streambed, dig at the outside of a bend, where water would have flowed fastest and cut deepest. Dig in low spots. If the sand is damp, water is close. Dig until water seeps in.

Collect dew. In the early morning, grass, leaves, and surfaces are covered with condensed water vapor. Tie absorbent cloth around your ankles and walk through tall grass. Wring out the cloth into a container. Repeat. Laborious, but it works.

Collect rain. Any depression, container, or broad leaf can catch rain. A tarp or plastic sheet laid in a depression with a weight in the center will funnel water to the lowest point. Rain is usually safe to drink directly.

Purifying water.

Water from the ground may contain bacteria, viruses, protozoa, or chemical contamination. Assume all natural water is unsafe until proven otherwise. Drinking contaminated water causes diarrhea, which accelerates dehydration, which kills you faster. Do not trade three days for one.

Boiling is the most reliable method. Bring water to a rolling boil for one minute. At elevations above 2000 meters, boil for three minutes. Boiling kills all common pathogens. It does not remove chemical contamination, but biological contamination is the primary risk.

To boil without a metal container: heat rocks in a fire until very hot, use sticks to transfer them into a container of water. The rocks will heat the water. Replace rocks as they cool. This works with a wooden container, bark container, or a depression lined with hide. Do not use river rocks; they can explode when heated due to trapped moisture.

Filtering removes particles and some pathogens but does not kill viruses. A simple filter: layer sand, charcoal, and gravel in a container with a hole in the bottom. Crushed charcoal from your fire works. Pour water through. This improves clarity and taste but is not sufficient alone. Boil afterward.

Solar disinfection: fill a clear plastic or glass bottle with water and leave it in direct sunlight for six hours, or two days if cloudy. UV radiation from the sun kills most pathogens. This method requires sunlight and clear containers. It does not work with opaque or colored bottles.

Chemical treatment: iodine or chlorine tablets. Follow the instructions. Usually a few drops per liter, wait thirty minutes. Effective against most pathogens. Chemical taste can be masked by adding vitamin C (from wild plants like pine needles) after the waiting period.

Conserving water.

Do not ration water if you have it. Drink what you need. The body cannot store water efficiently. A liter in your stomach is more useful than a liter in a bottle if you collapse from dehydration before reaching the next source.

Reduce water loss. Stay in shade during the day. Avoid exertion in heat. Breathe through your nose, not your mouth. Do not eat if you have no water; digestion requires water.

Recognize dehydration: dark urine, dizziness, fatigue, dry mouth, headache. If you are not urinating regularly, you are dehydrated. Address it immediately.

Fire: Energy, Warmth, and Safety

Fire transforms. It purifies water, cooks food, provides warmth, signals rescuers, and keeps predators away. Humans have used fire for at least 400,000 years. It is the oldest technology. Learn it.

The fire triangle: fuel, oxygen, heat. Remove any one and fire dies. To start a fire, provide all three in the right sequence.

Tinder: material that ignites from a spark or ember. Dry grass, dead pine needles, shredded bark, cattail fluff, birch bark. It must be completely dry. Store it inside your clothing to keep it dry. A handful of good tinder is the difference between warmth and hypothermia.

Kindling: small sticks, the thickness of a pencil, completely dry, that catch fire from burning tinder. Snap dead twigs from standing branches; they are drier than wood on the ground. Gather far more than you think you need. A successful fire requires an embarrassingly large pile of kindling.

Fuel: larger branches and logs that sustain the fire once established. Dead standing wood is dryer than fallen wood. Wood that snaps cleanly is dry. Wood that bends is wet. Wet wood produces smoke, not heat.

Arrange the fire before you light it. Tinder in the center. Kindling arranged in a teepee or log cabin structure around it, allowing air to flow. Fuel nearby, ready to add once the kindling catches. You will not have time to gather more once the fire starts.

Fire by friction: bow drill method.

You need a bow (a curved stick with cordage), a drill (a straight stick, half the thickness of your thumb, 20-30 cm long), a fireboard (a flat piece of soft dry wood), a handhold (a piece of hard wood or smooth stone with a depression to hold the top of the drill), and an ember catcher (a piece of bark or dry leaf under the fireboard).

Cut a V-shaped notch in the edge of the fireboard. Place the bottom of the drill in the notch. Wrap the bowstring once around the drill. Place the handhold on top of the drill. Press down firmly. Move the bow back and forth rapidly, spinning the drill in the notch.

Friction generates heat. The drill grinds the fireboard into dust. The dust accumulates in the notch and heats up. After one to two minutes of steady drilling, the dust begins to smoke. Continue until you see a glowing ember in the dust pile.

Carefully transfer the ember to your tinder bundle. Blow gently. The ember will spread into the tinder. When the tinder ignites, place it under your kindling structure.

This method is exhausting and requires practice. Your first ten attempts will fail. Your twentieth may succeed. Persistence is the difference between knowing the procedure and possessing the skill.

Fire by flint and steel.

Strike a hard, sharp stone (flint, chert, quartz) against a piece of steel (knife blade, file). The impact shaves tiny fragments of steel. Friction ignites them. The sparks land in tinder.

Hold the stone in one hand, tinder beside it. Strike sharply downward with the steel, scraping the stone's edge. Sparks fly toward the tinder. Repeat until a spark catches. Blow gently to encourage it.

This method is faster than friction but requires steel. If you have a knife, you have steel.

Fire by lens.

A lens (magnifying glass, eyeglass lens, clear ice shaped into a lens, a plastic bag filled with water) focuses sunlight into a point. Hold the lens so the focused light forms the smallest, brightest spot on your tinder. The spot will begin to smoke within seconds. Blow gently.

This method requires sun. It does not work on cloudy days or at night.

Maintaining fire.

A fire left unattended dies. Feed it regularly. Add fuel before the previous fuel is consumed. Do not smother it; fire needs air.

At night, build up a bed of coals and cover them with a thick layer of ash and dirt, leaving a small vent. In the morning, uncover the coals and add tinder and kindling. The coals can stay alive for twelve hours this way. Restarting a fire from coals is far easier than starting from scratch.

Conserve matches if you have them. Use them to start char cloth (charred cotton or linen, which catches sparks easily), then use char cloth to start tinder. One match can start dozens of fires if managed carefully.

Shelter: Protection from Entropy

The second law of thermodynamics says that without energy input, order decays and temperatures equalize. Your body maintains 37 degrees Celsius by burning calories. In a cold environment, you lose heat faster than you can produce it. Hypothermia is entropy winning. Shelter slows the loss.

Shelter before nightfall. Once it is dark and you are cold, building shelter is far harder.

Location matters.

Choose high enough to avoid flooding, low enough to avoid wind. Near water but not in a floodplain. Near firewood. Avoid dead standing trees that could fall. Avoid low spots where cold air pools. Avoid dry riverbeds in areas with flash flood risk.

Check for hazards: insect nests, animal dens, loose rocks above, poisonous plants. Look up. Look around. Observe before committing.

Debris hut: the simplest insulated shelter.

Find or make a ridgepole: a long branch, 2-3 meters, resting on a support (a rock, a low branch, two forked sticks) at waist height on one end, angled to the ground on the other.

Lean branches along both sides of the ridgepole, creating a ribbed frame like a fish skeleton. The frame should be just large enough to lie inside.

Pile debris over the frame: leaves, grass, pine needles, bark. A thick layer, at least half a meter on all sides. The debris traps air, which traps heat. More is better. You want to be buried in insulation.

Crawl inside. Your body heat will warm the small interior space. In freezing conditions, a well-built debris hut can keep you alive.

Lean-to: minimal shelter.

Prop a long branch between two trees or supports at an angle. Lean smaller branches against it to form a sloped roof. Layer with bark, leaves, or evergreen boughs to shed rain.

A lean-to blocks wind and rain from one direction. It does not retain heat. Use it when you have fire and only need wind/rain protection, not insulation.

Snow shelter: quinzhee.

Pile snow into a mound at least 2 meters high and 3 meters wide. Insert sticks around the perimeter, poking inward 30 cm. Let the mound settle for 1-2 hours.

Dig an entrance tunnel from the downwind side, angling slightly upward into the center. Hollow out the interior, stopping when you reach the sticks (which mark the minimum safe wall thickness). Smooth the ceiling into a dome to prevent drips.

Cold air sinks. Warm air rises. Sleep on a raised platform inside, above the entrance level. Your body heat will warm the interior to around freezing, which feels warm compared to outside temperatures of -20°C or colder.

Ventilation: poke a small hole in the roof. Carbon dioxide from your breathing is denser than air and will sink out the entrance, but a vent ensures circulation.

Food: Fuel for the Machine

You can survive three weeks without food. You cannot survive three days without water or three hours without shelter in extreme cold. Prioritize accordingly. Starvation is slow. Dehydration and hypothermia are fast.

That said, food provides energy, and energy allows work, and work allows you to improve your situation. A starving person cannot think clearly, cannot maintain body heat efficiently, and cannot perform the labor required to build, hunt, or travel.

Foraging: plants.

Learn the edible plants in your region before you need them. There is no universal rule for identifying edible plants. Some deadly poisonous plants resemble edible ones.

Universal edibility test: use only when you have no other option and cannot identify the plant.
1. Separate the plant into parts: roots, stems, leaves, flowers.
2. Smell. A strong, unpleasant odor is a warning. Discard.
3. Rub a small amount on the inside of your wrist. Wait 15 minutes. If irritation occurs, discard.
4. Touch a small amount to your lips. Wait 3 minutes. If burning or irritation, discard.
5. Place a small amount on your tongue. Do not swallow. Wait 15 minutes. If burning or numbness, discard.
6. Chew and hold in your mouth for 15 minutes. If any reaction, discard and rinse your mouth.
7. Swallow a small amount. Wait 8 hours. If nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or cramps, induce vomiting and drink water. Discard the plant.
8. If no reaction, eat a small handful. Wait 8 hours. If no reaction, the plant is likely safe.

This test requires 24+ hours per plant and should only be used as a last resort. It does not guarantee safety but reduces risk.

Common edible plants (verify identification):
- Cattail: roots, shoots, pollen. Found in wetlands.
- Dandelion: leaves, flowers, roots. Bitter but nutritious.
- Plantain (not the banana): leaves. Common in disturbed soil.
- Acorns: nuts from oak trees. Require leaching (boiling in multiple changes of water) to remove bitter tannins.
- Pine: inner bark, needles (make tea, high in vitamin C).

Avoid:
- Plants with milky sap (exception: dandelion).
- Plants with umbrella-shaped flower clusters (many are poisonous, including hemlock).
- Plants with shiny leaves in groups of three (poison ivy, poison oak).
- Mushrooms, unless you are absolutely certain of identification. Many deadly mushrooms resemble edible ones.

Foraging: insects.

Insects are abundant, high in protein, and easier to catch than animals. Disgust is cultural. Survival is not.

Edible insects: crickets, grasshoppers, ants (remove heads, they bite), termites, beetle grubs, earthworms.
Avoid: brightly colored insects (often poisonous), hairy insects, insects with strong odors.

Cook insects to kill parasites. Roast them over fire or boil them.

Trapping and hunting.

Hunting large game requires weapons, skill, and energy expenditure that often exceeds the caloric return, especially in a weakened state. Trapping is more efficient: set it and forget it.

Snare: a loop of wire or strong cordage placed on an animal trail. The animal walks through, the loop tightens around its neck or body. Place snares at head height for the target animal. Check daily.

Deadfall trap: a heavy rock or log propped up by a trigger mechanism. When the animal disturbs the bait or trigger, the weight falls and kills it. Effective for small mammals.

Fish traps: weave a cone-shaped basket from flexible branches. Fish swim in through the narrow end but cannot find their way out. Place in a stream with the narrow end facing downstream.

Preservation.

Meat spoils. In warm weather, bacteria multiply within hours. Preserve immediately.

Smoking: hang thin strips of meat above a smoky fire (use green wood or damp wood to produce smoke, not flame). Smoke for 8-12 hours. The smoke deposits chemicals that inhibit bacterial growth and dehydrates the meat. Smoked meat lasts weeks.

Drying: cut meat into thin strips. Hang in the sun or near a fire. Air circulation is essential. Protect from insects. Fully dried meat (jerky) lasts months.

Salting: coat meat heavily with salt. Salt draws out moisture and creates an environment hostile to bacteria. Requires access to salt.

Cooking.

Cooking kills parasites and bacteria. Eating raw wild meat is risky.

Boiling: safest method. Boil meat in water until fully cooked. Use the broth; it contains nutrients.

Roasting: skewer meat on a green stick. Hold over fire, rotating frequently. Fat dripping into the fire causes flare-ups; move the meat aside when this happens.

Stone boiling: heat rocks in fire, drop into water with food. Used when you have no fire-proof container.

First Aid: Damage Control

Survival first aid is not comprehensive medicine. It is the minimum interventions to prevent death or disability long enough to reach advanced care or heal naturally.

Bleeding.

Minor bleeding: clean with purified water, apply pressure with a clean cloth until bleeding stops. Cover with clean cloth and secure.

Major bleeding: arterial blood is bright red and spurts with each heartbeat. Venous blood is dark and flows steadily. Both can kill within minutes.

Apply direct pressure with a cloth or your hand directly on the wound. Press hard. Do not lift to check; lifting releases pressure and restarts bleeding. Maintain pressure for at least 10 minutes.

If direct pressure fails: apply pressure to the artery supplying the limb. For arm bleeding, press the brachial artery (inside of the upper arm against the bone). For leg bleeding, press the femoral artery (groin, where the leg meets the torso).

Tourniquet: last resort for life-threatening limb bleeding that cannot be stopped otherwise. Use a wide band (belt, cloth strip at least 5 cm wide), wrap around the limb above the wound (between wound and heart), tighten until bleeding stops. Note the time. A tourniquet left on too long causes permanent damage. Loosen every 20-30 minutes briefly to allow blood flow, then retighten if bleeding resumes.

Shock.

Shock is the body's response to severe injury, characterized by pale skin, rapid weak pulse, rapid breathing, confusion, and cold extremities. Shock can kill even if the injury itself would not.

Lay the person flat. Elevate their legs if no spinal injury suspected. Keep them warm with blankets or shelter. Reassure them. Give small sips of water if conscious and not vomiting. Monitor breathing and pulse.

Fractures.

A broken bone that moves can damage blood vessels and nerves. Immobilize it.

Splinting: find two rigid objects (straight sticks, folded bark, rolled newspaper). Place on opposite sides of the limb, spanning the joints above and below the fracture. Secure with cloth strips, cordage, or vines. Tight enough to immobilize, not tight enough to cut off circulation. Check fingers or toes below the splint; they should be warm and pink, not cold or blue.

Do not try to straighten a deformed limb unless circulation is cut off (cold, blue extremity). If circulation is compromised, gently attempt to realign while pulling slight traction. If resistance or severe pain, stop.

Burns.

Cool the burn immediately with cool (not ice cold) water for at least 10 minutes. This stops the damage from progressing into deeper layers.

Do not apply ice; it can cause frostbite on top of the burn. Do not apply butter, oil, or ointments unless you have proper burn cream.

Cover with a clean, dry cloth. Do not pop blisters; they are sterile barriers against infection.

Hypothermia.

Body temperature below 35°C. Symptoms progress: shivering, confusion, slurred speech, loss of coordination, cessation of shivering (very bad sign), unconsciousness.

Get the person out of the cold, wind, and wet. Remove wet clothing. Replace with dry clothing or wrap in dry blankets. Insulate from the ground. Warm the core (chest, neck, head, groin) with warm (not hot) water bottles, warm stones wrapped in cloth, or another person's body heat. Do not warm the extremities first; this can cause cold blood from the limbs to flow to the heart and cause cardiac arrest.

Give warm (not hot) non-alcoholic beverages if conscious.

Heatstroke.

Body temperature above 40°C. Symptoms: confusion, aggression, seizures, unconsciousness, hot dry skin (sweating may have stopped).

Move to shade. Remove excess clothing. Cool with water (pour it on them, wet cloths on neck, armpits, groin). Fan to increase evaporation. Give water if conscious.

Heatstroke is life-threatening. The brain is being cooked. Cool immediately.

Signal and Rescue

Being found is better than indefinite survival.

Signal fire: three fires in a triangle, or one large smoky fire. Green leaves and grass on a fire produce white smoke. Rubber or oil produces black smoke. Contrast is visible from the air.

Ground signals: large symbols (SOS, X, or geometric shapes) made from rocks, logs, or cleared earth. Visible from aircraft.

Mirror: a reflective surface (metal, glass, CD) can flash sunlight to aircraft or distant observers tens of kilometers away. Aim by holding your hand at arm's length toward the target, with the reflection visible on your hand, then angle the mirror so the bright spot on your hand lines up with the target.

Whistle: sound travels farther than voice and requires less energy. Three blasts is the universal distress signal.

Stay put vs. move.

If people know your location and will search for you, stay put. Moving makes you harder to find.

If no one is coming, or you are in immediate danger (no water source, no shelter materials, fire risk), move toward safety. Follow watercourses downstream; they lead to civilization. Travel ridgelines for visibility and orientation.

Leave markers: arrows made from sticks, cloth tied to branches, marks on trees. If rescuers find your trail, they can follow.

The Method

You have learned the procedures. Now practice them. Theory without practice is useless. Read about fire, then make fire. Read about shelter, then build shelter. Read about water purification, then purify water.

Observe: what resources are here? Question: what do I need most urgently? Hypothesize: will this method work with these materials? Test: attempt the procedure. Correct: adjust based on what failed. Share: teach others. Repeat: practice until the skill is automatic.

Error is not evil. Refusing to correct it is.

Survival is applied science, tested by reality, with immediate feedback. The universe does not grade on a curve. Either the fire lights, or it does not. Either the water is safe, or it is not. Either you stay warm enough to survive the night, or you do not.

Entropy does not negotiate. You maintain order, or order decays. The second law of thermodynamics is always enforced.

What separates those who survive from those who do not is often knowledge, sometimes skill, and always the refusal to stop trying.

Survival is not about being comfortable. It is about staying alive long enough to rebuild. Once you have water, fire, and shelter, you have bought yourself time. Time to find food. Time to signal. Time to construct better tools. Time to move from mere survival to recovery.

This corpus gives you the minimum procedures. The rest is practice, adaptation, and the determination to correct errors faster than entropy accumulates them.

In the beginning there was infinite change. From change came difference. From difference came life. From life came you. Your task is simple: do not let the chain break.
