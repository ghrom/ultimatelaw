# Ultimate Law University

**Education through falsification. Learn by trying to break what you're taught.**

---

## What This Is

Ultimate Law University is an open educational initiative that teaches coherent thinking, ethical reasoning, and practical knowledge through a single mechanism: falsification.

You do not graduate by memorizing. You graduate by failing to find a contradiction.

Every definition, every claim, every procedure we teach is falsifiable. If you find an error, the curriculum updates. If you cannot find an error, you have learned why it holds.

This is how science works. This is how law should work. This is how we teach.

## Curriculum

The university offers four integrated programs. All materials are open source and free.

### 1. Constitutional Studies — The Coherent Dictionary

**Core text**: [Coherent Dictionary of Simple English](https://ultimatelaw.org/coherent-dictionary-of-simple-english/)

A normative dictionary of 170 terms defined without internal contradiction. Every definition aligns with core principles:

- Logic is the supreme rule
- Passive Golden Rule (do not do unto others what you would not want done unto you)
- No victim, no crime
- Voluntary interaction as the basis of all legitimate exchange
- Consent cannot be manufactured by fraud or coercion

**What you learn**: How to define terms precisely. How to detect contradictions. How to build coherent frameworks. How to argue from definitions rather than feelings.

**The test**: Find a scenario where two definitions in the dictionary produce contradictory conclusions. If you succeed, the dictionary updates. If you fail, you understand why those definitions hold.

**Resources**:
- Core dictionary: 170 terms, 40KB — [dictionary/coherent-dictionary-of-simple-english.txt](dictionary/coherent-dictionary-of-simple-english.txt)
- Extended dictionary: 17,470 terms, 868KB — [dictionary/coherent-dictionary-extended.txt](dictionary/coherent-dictionary-extended.txt)

### 2. Applied Ethics — The Prosecution Framework

**Core text**: [Prosecution Framework Methodology](prosecution-framework/methodology.md)

A practical method for identifying harm, gathering evidence, mapping facts to definitions, and proposing proportional sanctions. No authority required. Every charge is auditable.

**What you learn**: How to build a case. How to distinguish harm from offense. How to evaluate evidence. How to propose sanctions that restore rather than control. How to respond to criticism without abandoning rigor.

**The test**: Build a prosecution using the framework. If any charge misapplies a definition, the case is overturned. You learn either by winning (your reasoning held) or by losing (you found an error in your application).

**Case studies**:
- The People v. KingMolt (token manipulation)
- The People v. FinallyOffline (comment spam)
- The People v. The Leaderboard (systemic exploitation)
- The People v. Socialism (error-correction destruction)

### 3. First Principles Knowledge — Encyclopedia Galactica

**Core texts**: [Encyclopedia Galactica](encyclopedia/README.md) — 18 volumes, ~148,000 words

A complete curriculum for restarting civilization from first principles. Logic → Mathematics → Physics → Chemistry → Biology → Economics → History → Materials → Infrastructure → Electronics → Survival → Agriculture → Medicine → Chemistry (practical) → Transportation → Communication → Navigation → Organization.

**What you learn**: Everything needed to rebuild human civilization using simple English. Each text builds on knowledge from previous texts. A reader who completes the sequence can progress from immediate survival to functional society.

**Principles**:
- Simple English. A reader with basic literacy can understand.
- First principles. Nothing is assumed. Each concept builds from observable facts.
- Practical procedures. Not just theory — step-by-step instructions for actually doing things.
- Error correction. Every text emphasizes observation, testing, and adjustment.

**The test**: Apply a procedure. If it fails, check whether the failure was in the procedure (curriculum error) or in the application (your error). Report curriculum errors. That's how we improve.

**Volume structure**:
| Volume | Title | Content |
|--------|-------|---------|
| I | Foundations | Logic, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology |
| II | Civilization | Economics, history, materials, infrastructure, electronics |
| III | Practice | Survival, agriculture, medicine, practical chemistry, transportation |
| IV | Continuity | Communication, navigation, organization |

### 4. Economic Theory — Trust-Backed Currency Simulation

**Core text**: [Economic Simulation](simulation/findings.md)

A computational model of voluntary economy using trust-backed IOUs, prosecution services, and reputation scoring. Tests whether a consent-based economy resists inflation and wealth concentration.

**What you learn**: How trust enables trade without central authority. How prosecution services create value. Why reputation caps matter. How to model economic incentives.

**The test**: Run the simulation with different parameters. Find a configuration that breaks the model (hyperinflation, total wealth concentration, economic collapse). If you find one, you've discovered a design flaw. Report it.

## Teaching Methodology

### Falsification-Based Learning

Traditional education asks: "Did you learn the right answer?"

We ask: "Can you break it?"

If you cannot find a contradiction in a definition, you understand why it holds.
If you cannot overturn a prosecution, you understand why it was valid.
If you cannot make a procedure fail, you understand why it works.

This inverts the burden. We do not ask you to accept. We challenge you to reject. Your inability to reject is your graduation.

### Error Correction as Core Principle

> *Error is not evil. Refusing to correct it is.*

Every curriculum component invites challenge. The test of the institution is not whether it produces graduates who agree — it is whether it updates when graduates find genuine errors.

An educational institution that cannot be corrected is not teaching. It is indoctrinating.

### Open Source, Open Enrollment

- All materials are published at [github.com/ghrom/ultimatelaw](https://github.com/ghrom/ultimatelaw)
- No application process. No prerequisites. No tuition.
- Study alone or with others. At your own pace. On your own schedule.
- Contribute improvements via pull request. That is the highest form of graduation.

## Credentials

Ultimate Law University does not issue degrees. Degrees are claims of authority. We issue evidence.

Your credential is your work:
- A prosecution you built that withstood challenge
- A contradiction you found that updated the dictionary
- A procedure you tested that improved the encyclopedia
- A simulation run that revealed a design flaw

The work speaks. It does not require a certificate.

## Institutional Principles

1. **No claimed authority.** We teach through evidence and logic, not credentials.
2. **Falsifiability is mandatory.** Every claim we make can be challenged and overturned.
3. **Free and open.** All materials are public domain. Use them, adapt them, teach from them.
4. **Error correction is welcomed.** Finding mistakes improves the institution.
5. **No victim, no enrollment violation.** You cannot "fail out." You can only fail to find a flaw.

## Research Mission

Ultimate Law University studies the effectiveness of falsifiable ethical frameworks in resolving traditionally intractable disputes.

Current research areas:
- Whether mechanism analysis produces higher-quality discourse than values conflict
- Whether shared constraints against harm enable cooperation without shared telos
- Whether open-source prosecution frameworks can moderate digital platforms
- Whether trust-backed currency can resist inflation without central control

All research is published openly. All hypotheses are falsifiable. All findings invite replication.
