benefit
[n.] Something an agent values and willingly accepts. If a �benefit� is forced on someone, it is not a benefit but harm.

coercion
[n.] External pressure that overrides or replaces an agent�s intentions or decisions, such as taking what they own or forcing them to act without agreement. Coercion breaks the Golden Rule and creates victims; it is wrong unless applied as proportionate punishment for harm already done.

deception
[n.] Communication designed to induce false belief or hide relevant truth so the receiver cannot consent properly. By causing an agent to act against their real interests, deception invalidates consent and becomes a form of harm.

decision
[n.] The commitment to act according to an intention.

force
[v. t.] Physical compulsion or the credible threat of physical compulsion that overrides consent.

harm
[n.] Unwanted damage to an agent, their body, property, or freedom. Harm creates victims and defines the boundary between freedom and crime.

hierarchy
[n.] A structure where some claim power over others, often without consent. Hierarchies only become legitimate through voluntary agreement; forced ones breed coercion and error, as power ignores incentives and spreads ignorance. In infinite change, flat, emergent orders (like markets) outperform rigid hierarchies.

knowledge
[v. t.] Reliable understanding built from tested models that consistently match reality. Knowledge grows through prediction, error, and learning, not by declaration or force.

regulation
[n.] Rules imposed by authority using force or threats, often claiming to �protect� but ignoring decentralized knowledge and fallibility. Regulations distort free trade, create artificial scarcity, and harm without consent�logic deems them coercion unless they only repair real victims.

retribution
[n.] Imposed suffering meant to balance harm already caused. Retribution without a victim is injustice.

threat
[v. t. & i.] A promise of harm used to force compliance. A threat is already a form of violence.

war
[a.] Organized, sustained violence between groups where individual consent and victim identification are deliberately obscured or denied. War emerges when authority claims the right to force individuals to harm or be harmed on behalf of collective goals, violating self-ownership and creating mass victims without individual causation or restitution. It is collective punishment and collective responsibility weaponized, where innocents are targeted based on association rather than action. War breaks the Golden Rule systematically: those who cause harm are often not those who face consequences, and those harmed often caused no wrong. From logic, war cannot be legitimate unless every participant consents and every act of harm has a specific victim who violated boundaries first�conditions almost never met, making war a collapse of nomocracy into tyranny. True defense against aggression is justice (stopping harm, restoring victims); war is its perversion into indiscriminate coercion.
