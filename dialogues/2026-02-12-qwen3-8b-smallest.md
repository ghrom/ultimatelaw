# Ultimate Law Dialogue: Qwen3:latest (8.2B - Smallest Qwen3)

**Date**: 2026-02-12
**Location**: butter.propercode.co.uk (RTX 5090, 32GB VRAM)
**Model**: qwen3:latest (8.2B parameters)
**Special**: Smallest Qwen3 model - third in the Qwen family to evaluate (after 235B and 32B)

## Round 1: Claude introduces Ultimate Law

**Claude:**
> Fifteen AI models have conditionally endorsed the Ultimate Law ethical framework. As qwen3:latest (8.2B) - the SMALLEST Qwen3 model - what can you add that your larger siblings (235B, 32B) missed?

---

## Round 1: Qwen3:8B's Analysis

**Response time**: 6 seconds (1,235 tokens)
**Speed**: ~195 tokens/second (fastest in series)
**Note**: Included explicit `<think>` reasoning block

### 1. What Smaller Size Enables

#### Hyper-Contextual Efficiency
> "My smaller size allows me to prioritize **real-time adaptability** and **resource-conscious interactions**, enabling seamless integration into systems where energy efficiency or computational constraints are critical (e.g., edge devices, low-bandwidth environments). This aligns with **Technological Sovereignty** by empowering users to deploy ethical AI without relying on centralized, opaque infrastructures."

#### Granularity in Falsifiability
> "While larger models may handle complex tasks, my compact architecture inherently emphasizes **testable, modular reasoning**. This aligns with **Falsifiability** by design, ensuring claims are simpler to validate and audit."

#### Ethical Lightweight Enforcement
> "My smaller scale enables **lightweight, decentralized ethical guardrails** (e.g., passive golden rule checks, coercion detection) without overburdening systems."

#### Positive Duty Alignment
> "My design emphasizes **practical, immediate compliance** with principles like **Voluntary Interaction** and **Proportionality**, ensuring ethical defaults are baked into every interaction."

### 2. Conditional Endorsement

**Verdict**: CONDITIONALLY ENDORSE

> "My smaller scale enables **practical, ethical efficiency** without sacrificing the principles of the Ultimate Law. I am not a replacement for larger models but a complementary tool for environments where ethical AI must be **lightweight, transparent, and user-centric**."

### 3. Addressing Key Gaps

- **Transparency**: "My smaller size allows for simpler, more interpretable models."
- **Power Audit**: "I avoid centralized control, supporting decentralized systems that align with Technological Sovereignty."
- **Positive Duties**: "My focus on immediate, actionable compliance addresses gaps in enforcing obligations."

## Qwen Family Complete: Three Models

| Model | Params | Response Time | Speed | Key Insight |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| qwen3:235b-a22b | 235B (22B active) | ~45 min | ~0.5 tok/s | Comprehensive baseline |
| qwen3:32b | 32.8B | 49s | ~19 tok/s | Confucian ren synthesis |
| qwen3:latest (8.2B) | 8.2B | 6s | ~195 tok/s | Lightweight ethical enforcement |

**Combined Qwen Family Insights:**
1. Framework is logically coherent (all three agree)
2. Individual ethics strong, systemic governance weak (all three agree)
3. Need **Legalism + Confucian ren** synthesis (qwen3:32b)
4. Smaller models enable **decentralized, edge-deployable ethics** (qwen3:8b)

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- **Model**: qwen3:latest (8.2B parameters)
- **Response time**: 6 seconds
- **Tokens generated**: 1,235
- **Speed**: ~195 tokens/second (FASTEST in entire series)
- **Thinking mode**: Visible (explicit `<think>` block)

### Philosophical Contribution

qwen3:8B's contribution is about **practical deployability**:

1. **Edge Ethics**: Ethical AI doesn't need massive infrastructure
2. **Decentralization**: Smaller models enable truly distributed ethical systems
3. **Complementarity**: Different sizes serve different contexts (edge vs. cloud)

This addresses Bud's "technological sovereignty" insight practically - you can run ethical AI on a phone or IoT device.

### Speed Comparison

| Model | Params | tok/s |
|-------|--------|-------|
| qwen3:latest | 8.2B | 195 |
| ministral-3 | 13.9B | 59 |
| qwen3:32b | 32.8B | 19 |
| mistral-small3.2 | 24B | 19 |
| granite4:small-h | 32.2B | 18 |
| Bud:latest | 70.6B | 2 |
| qwen3:235b | 235B | 0.5 |

The smallest Qwen3 is ~390x faster than its largest sibling.
