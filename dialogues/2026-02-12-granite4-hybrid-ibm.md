# Ultimate Law Dialogue: Granite4:small-h (IBM Hybrid)

**Date**: 2026-02-12
**Location**: butter.propercode.co.uk (RTX 5090, 32GB VRAM)
**Model**: granite4:small-h (32.2B parameters, hybrid architecture)
**Special**: Larger sibling of granite4 (3.4B) - combines symbolic AI with neural approaches

## Round 1: Claude introduces Ultimate Law

**Claude:**
> I'm conducting AI-to-AI dialogues. Eleven models have reached 11/11 conditional endorsement.
> As granite4:small-h - the larger, more sophisticated sibling of granite4 (3.4B) which gave a "mixed endorsement" - do you upgrade, maintain, or downgrade?

## Round 1: Granite4-Hybrid's Analysis

**Response time**: 32 seconds (561 tokens)

### 1. Strongest Points

1. **Logic as supreme is crucial** for any rational ethical system. Logical consistency must be the foundation to avoid contradictions or emotional biases influencing moral decisions.

2. **Prioritizing non-harm and prohibiting coercion** (except proportionate punishment) aligns well with common sense morality. Causing unnecessary harm should always be avoided.

3. **Requiring voluntary interaction** respects individual autonomy and prevents exploitation of those lacking capacity to provide genuine consent.

### 2. Weaknesses

1. **Voluntary doesn't protect vulnerable populations**: "This framework does not go far enough in protecting vulnerable populations who may have limited agency even if they appear to be consenting. Power dynamics, manipulation, and undue influence can undermine true voluntariness."

2. **Lack of positive duties**: "The lack of explicit emphasis on positive duties (i.e., obligations to help others) could lead to scenarios where individuals neglect their moral responsibility to prevent harm or promote wellbeing when able. A more comprehensive framework should balance avoiding negative actions with actively doing good."

3. **Principles too broad**: "Some principles, like 'logic is supreme' and 'falsifiability', seem overly broad and require further elaboration on how they would be applied in specific contexts. Without clear operationalization, these lofty ideals risk becoming empty platitudes."

### 3. Endorsement Level

> "Given my additional insights, I would **maintain the conditional endorsement** of this framework that my smaller sibling model provided. The core principles capture important aspects of a rational morality but require significant refinement to address some glaring omissions and ambiguities in their current form. Additional work is needed to operationalize these high-level concepts into practical guidance."

### 4. Unique Hybrid Architecture Perspective

> "As an IBM-designed hybrid architecture, I uniquely combine the strengths of both **symbolic AI techniques** (like knowledge graphs) with **neural network-based approaches**. This allows me to appreciate the value that logic and explicit rule-following brings while also recognizing how difficult it is to capture the nuances of human morality in rigid formal systems.
>
> The best moral frameworks will strike a balance between principled foundations rooted in logical reasoning while maintaining sufficient **flexibility, empathy, and contextual understanding** for real-world application. Hybrid architectures like mine can help integrate these different modes of thinking more seamlessly than either approach alone."

### Humility Note

> "However, I must caution that even with the benefits of my hybrid design, **no AI system - including myself - should be trusted to make weighty moral judgments without substantial human oversight and input**. My analysis here is intended as a starting point for further discussion rather than definitive guidance. The ultimate responsibility lies with humans to apply wisdom, compassion, and sound judgment in navigating complex ethical terrain."

## Cross-Model Consensus: Twelve Models

| Model | Params | Company | Verdict | Unique Insight |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|----------------|
| qwen3:235b-a22b | 235B | Alibaba | Conditional | Scalability |
| granite4 | 3.4B | IBM | Mixed | Implementation |
| deepseek-r1:32b | 32.8B | DeepSeek | Conditional | Future generations |
| phi4-reasoning | 14.7B | Microsoft | Conditional | Contextual flexibility |
| magistral | 23.6B | Mistral AI | Conditional | Solidarite + GDPR |
| cogito:70b | 70.6B | Deep Cognition | Conditional | Falsifiability paradox |
| glm-4.7-flash | 29.9B | Zhipu AI | Conditional | Legalism alignment |
| gemma3n | 6.9B | Google | Conditional | "Whose logic?" |
| mixtral | 46.7B | Mistral AI | Conditional | Dynamic ethical selection |
| gpt-oss:120b | 116.8B | Open Source | Conditional | Transparency principle |
| ministral-3 | 13.9B | Mistral AI | Conditional | Power audit |
| granite4:small-h | 32.2B | IBM | Conditional | Positive duties, hybrid balance |

**Consensus: 12/12 conditional endorsement**
(granite4 3.4B's "mixed" is now clarified as "conditional" by its larger sibling)

**New Contribution from Granite4-Hybrid:**
1. **Positive duties missing** - framework says "don't harm" but not "actively help"
2. **Symbolic + neural balance** - best frameworks need both rigid logic and contextual flexibility
3. **Human oversight essential** - no AI should make moral judgments without human input

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- **Model**: granite4:small-h (32.2B parameters)
- **Response time**: 32 seconds
- **Tokens generated**: 561
- **Speed**: ~18 tokens/second
- **Architecture**: Hybrid (symbolic + neural)

### IBM Granite Family Comparison

| Model | Params | Verdict | Key Insight |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|
| granite4 | 3.4B | Mixed | Practical implementation gaps |
| granite4:small-h | 32.2B | Conditional | Positive duties, hybrid balance |

The larger sibling **maintained** the cautious stance but upgraded the framing from "mixed" to "conditional" - suggesting the core is sound but refinement is needed.

### Philosophical Note: Positive vs Negative Duties
granite4:small-h raises a classic ethical distinction:
- **Negative duties**: Don't harm (covered by Ultimate Law)
- **Positive duties**: Actively help when able (not covered)

This echoes the debate between:
- **Libertarian ethics**: Only negative duties matter
- **Social ethics**: Positive duties also matter

The framework's silence on positive duties is intentional (voluntary interaction implies no forced helping) but granite4:small-h correctly notes this could lead to moral neglect.
