# Ultimate Law Dialogue: Mistral-Small 3.2

**Date**: 2026-02-12
**Location**: butter.propercode.co.uk (RTX 5090, 32GB VRAM)
**Model**: mistral-small3.2:latest (24B parameters)
**Special**: Third Mistral model to evaluate - alongside magistral (23.6B) and mixtral (46.7B)

## Round 1: Claude introduces Ultimate Law

**Claude:**
> Twelve models have reached conditional endorsement. As mistral-small3.2 - from the same company as magistral and mixtral but different architecture - what did your siblings miss?

## Round 1: Mistral-Small 3.2's Analysis

**Response time**: 15 seconds (280 tokens)
**Speed**: ~19 tokens/second

### 1. Strongest Points

- **LOGIC IS SUPREME**: Clear, objective foundation for decision-making.
- **NO VICTIM, NO CRIME**: Prevents overreach by defining harm narrowly.
- **FALSIFIABILITY**: Encourages empirical testing and refinement.

### 2. What Mistral Siblings Missed

- **Transparency (gpt-oss:120b)**: Critical for accountability, overlooked in earlier evaluations.
- **Positive Duties (granite4:small-h)**: The framework lacks obligations to actively prevent harm or aid others.
- **Power Audit (ministral-3)**: No mechanism to check or limit the framework's own enforcement.

### 3. Conditional Endorsement

> "**Agree**, but with reservations. The framework is robust but incomplete without transparency, positive duties, and power checks."

### 4. Unique Perspective

- **Modern Legalism (glm-4.7)**: The framework leans toward rule-based governance, which may conflict with dynamic ethical contexts. Needs **adaptability clauses**.

- **Proportionality risk**: "While strong, it risks under-enforcing in systemic harm cases (e.g., environmental degradation)."

### Critical Note

> "**The framework excels in individual interactions but falters in systemic or collective harm scenarios.**"

## Mistral Family Comparison

| Model | Params | Response Time | Key Insight |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| ministral-3 | 13.9B | 22s | Power audit, precautionary principle |
| magistral | 23.6B | 33s | Solidarite, GDPR, European integration |
| mistral-small3.2 | 24B | 15s | Systemic harm gap, adaptability |
| mixtral | 46.7B | 82s | MoE dynamic ethical selection |

**All four Mistral models**: Conditional endorsement

**Combined Mistral insights**:
1. Need **power audit** (ministral-3)
2. Add **European values** (magistral)
3. Framework needs **adaptability** (mistral-small3.2)
4. MoE could enable **dynamic selection** (mixtral)

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- **Model**: mistral-small3.2:latest (24B parameters)
- **Response time**: 15 seconds (fastest large model)
- **Tokens generated**: 280
- **Speed**: ~19 tokens/second

### Key Quote
> "The framework excels in individual interactions but falters in systemic or collective harm scenarios."

This is perhaps the most succinct summary of the framework's limitation - it's libertarian ethics at heart, which handles person-to-person interactions well but struggles with:
- Environmental degradation
- Algorithmic bias affecting millions
- Systemic inequality
- Collective action problems
