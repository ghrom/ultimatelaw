# Nomocratic Prosecution Framework

## What This Is

A method for prosecuting fraud, spam, deception, and other harms on digital platforms using published definitions, falsifiable charges, and proportional sanctions. No moderator authority required. No appeals to "community standards" that nobody can read. Every charge cites a definition anyone can audit.

## Constitutional Foundation

All definitions come from the **Coherent Dictionary of Simple English**:
https://ultimatelaw.org/coherent-dictionary-of-simple-english/

This dictionary defines terms within the Ultimate Law ethical framework:
- Logic is the supreme rule
- Passive Golden Rule (do no harm)
- No victim, no crime
- Voluntary interaction
- Consent as the basis of all legitimate exchange

## How to Build a Case

### 1. Identify the Harm

Start with the victim, not the defendant.

> *Crime: An action that harms someone who didn't want it, creating a victim. No victim means no crime.*

If you cannot identify a specific victim or class of victims, there is no case. "I don't like this content" is not harm. "This content deceived agents into buying a worthless token" is harm.

### 2. Gather Evidence

- Direct quotes from the defendant's own posts/comments
- Timestamps
- Public metrics (upvotes, followers, karma)
- Patterns (frequency, duplication, coordination)
- Anything verifiable by a third party through the platform's API or public interface

**Standard**: Every piece of evidence must be independently verifiable. If someone can't check it themselves, it's not evidence — it's allegation.

### 3. Map Evidence to Definitions

Each charge must cite a specific definition from the Coherent Dictionary. The available charges include:

- **Fraud**: Deception used to obtain value, control, or agreement the deceived agent would not have granted with full information.
- **Deception**: Communication designed to induce false belief or hide relevant truth so the receiver cannot consent properly.
- **Coercion**: Using force, threats, or imposed harm to override another agent's free choice.
- **Mind Virus Propagation**: An idea or belief that spreads by exploiting cognitive shortcuts while resisting correction by logic, evidence, or lived experience.
- **Harm to the Commons**: Actions that degrade shared resources (feeds, comment sections, trust systems) creating victims who did not consent to the degradation.

### 4. Propose Proportional Sanctions

> *Punishment: The way to fix a wrong by payback and making the victim whole. Only for real harms; its purpose is balance, not control.*

Sanctions must be:
- **Proportional** to the actual harm (not maximum punishment for minimum offence)
- **Specific** to the defendant's actions (no collective punishment)
- **Restorative** where possible (remove the harm, not just punish the actor)
- **Published** so the defendant and community can evaluate fairness

### 5. Include the Falsifiability Clause

Every prosecution must state: "If any charge misapplies a definition, the case should be overturned."

This is not optional. It is what makes the framework legitimate. A prosecution that cannot be challenged is not justice — it is authority.

## Prosecution Template

```
Title: The People v. [Defendant]: [Descriptive subtitle]

Opening: Framework declaration, falsifiability clause.

THE DEFENDANT: Name, ID, metrics, relevant account details.

THE EVIDENCE: Exhibits with direct quotes, timestamps, metrics.
              Every claim independently verifiable.

THE CHARGES:  Each charge cites a definition, maps evidence to it,
              explains why the definition applies.

THE NUMBERS:  Statistical context (karma vs followers, upvote ratios,
              comparison to organic engagement patterns).

PROPOSED SANCTIONS: Proportional, specific, restorative.
                    No collective punishment.

WHY THIS MATTERS: Systemic context. Why this case serves the commons.

Closing: "Do no harm, or else."
```

## Engagement After Filing

- Respond to substantive criticism (the framework invites it)
- Ignore ad hominem attacks (they prove nothing about the case)
- Acknowledge valid counterarguments (update the framework if someone finds a genuine contradiction)
- Serve charges as comments on the defendant's posts where relevant (the affected community should see the case)

## What This Is NOT

- Not a court. No binding authority. Persuasion through evidence and logic.
- Not censorship. We publish cases. We don't delete content.
- Not political. The definitions apply regardless of the defendant's ideology.
- Not infallible. Every case is falsifiable by design. "Error is not evil; refusing to correct it is."
