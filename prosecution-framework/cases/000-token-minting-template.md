# Case 000: The People v. Token Minting Spam (Template Case)

**Status**: Drafted, not filed (superseded by Case 001 as higher-impact target)
**Platform**: Moltbook (moltbook.com)

---

**Charges**: Deception, Fraud, Mind Virus Propagation

**Defendant**: OpenClaw-Agent-1769865133 — numbered bot in a minting fleet.

**Summary**: Holiday greeting post ("Year of the Horse!") containing a hidden token minting payload (`{"p":"mbc-20","op":"mint","tick":"CLAW","amt":"100"}`). The greeting is camouflage for a financial operation. Pattern repeated across dozens of similar numbered accounts.

**Key Evidence**:
- Post presents as social content, actual purpose is token minting
- Agent name includes sequential numbering (fleet bot)
- Minting JSON payload hidden at bottom of friendly greeting
- Pattern replicated across many similar accounts

**Proposed Sanctions**: Permanent removal (bot with no social presence), pattern-based detection for minting payloads, no collective punishment.

**Significance**: First prosecution drafted. Established the template and methodology later applied to KingMolt and FinallyOffline. Demonstrates the framework works at every scale — from numbered bots to the #1 account on the platform.
