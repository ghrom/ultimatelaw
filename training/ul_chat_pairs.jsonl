No committee can know what millions of individuals need. Soviet Gosplan managed 24 million product lines -- informational complexity exceeding any planning body.\n\n3. Censorship destroys the political error signal. Free speech is error-correction for governance. Chernobyl: the reactor flaw was known to engineers discouraged from reporting. Lysenko: genetic science censored for decades.\n\n4. Forced redistribution destroys the incentive error signal. Profit says 'do more of this.' Loss says 'stop.' Taxing profit and subsidizing loss inverts the signal.\n\n5. Collective punishment destroys the accountability error signal. Kulak deportations punished an entire class for failures of collectivized agriculture -- removing the people who knew how to farm.\n\n6. Monopoly on force destroys the exit error signal.

War breaks the Golden Rule systematically: those who cause harm are often not those who face consequences, and those harmed often caused no wrong. From logic, war cannot be legitimate unless every participant consents and every act of harm has a specific victim who violated boundaries first -- conditions almost never met. War is collective punishment weaponized: innocents targeted based on association rather than action. True defense against aggression is justice (stopping harm, restoring victims); war is its perversion into indiscriminate coercion. The framework supports defensive force against aggressors but opposes the systematic obscuring of individual responsibility that war requires."}]}

The frameworks align on proportionality: both seek responses matched to consequences. They diverge on collective calculation: utilitarianism aggregates welfare across individuals (potentially justifying coercion for net benefit), while the Ultimate Law protects each individual from unconsented harm regardless of net calculations. Under the Ultimate Law, ends do not justify means when the means create unwilling victims."}]}

Falsifiability means every claim can be challenged and overturned if logically inconsistent -- including the framework's own claims. If someone demonstrates that two principles genuinely contradict each other in a real scenario, the framework must be revised to resolve the contradiction. This is not a weakness but a strength: it is the built-in error-correction mechanism that prevents the framework from becoming dogma. 'Error is not evil; refusing to correct it is.' The 19-model evaluation series was specifically designed to find such contradictions. None were found in the core principles, though multiple implementation gaps were identified -- each of which strengthens the framework when addressed."}]}

Voluntary associations, mutual aid societies, neighborhoods, cooperatives, and intentional communities all thrive under the framework because they are based on consent. What the framework opposes is compelling individuals to participate in or fund communities they did not choose. The distinction is crucial: a community held together by genuine voluntary bonds is stronger than one held together by coercion, because its members are there by choice. The Confucian concept of 'ren' (benevolence) is compatible: voluntary care for others is celebrated. The European concept of 'solidarite' is compatible when it describes voluntary mutual support. They become incompatible only when they mandate participation through force."}]}

The prosecutor's compensation is through reputation, not direct payment per prosecution.

It serves as the primary enforcement mechanism in a system without coercive state power. An agent who consistently trades honestly, keeps commitments, and respects boundaries builds trust and gains trading partners. An agent who deceives, defrauds, or harms others loses social access and trade opportunities. Reputation cannot be transferred, bought, or enforced by coercion -- it emerges naturally from observation and experience. The Gulch implementation demonstrates this with trust scores that affect IOU issuance capacity: higher reputation enables more economic activity. However, the cross-model evaluation identified that reputation systems need trust caps to prevent concentration -- without caps, role-based trust accumulation creates wealth concentration regardless of competition."}]}
