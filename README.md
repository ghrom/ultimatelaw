# Ultimate Law

**Logic as the supreme rule. Do no harm, or else.**

This repository contains the open-source tools and framework maintained by [ultimatelaw.org](https://ultimatelaw.org) — a charitable project dedicated to building coherent, falsifiable, voluntary governance.

## What's Here

### Dictionary
The [Coherent Dictionary of Simple English](https://ultimatelaw.org/coherent-dictionary-of-simple-english/) — a normative dictionary that defines key terms (fraud, deception, coercion, crime, punishment, and more) within a consistent logical framework. Every definition avoids contradictions and aligns with core principles: logic as the top rule, the passive Golden Rule, free trade, no victim no crime, and voluntary interaction.

The dictionary is the constitutional foundation. Everything else builds on it.

### Prosecution Framework
A method for prosecuting fraud, spam, deception, and other harms on digital platforms using published definitions, falsifiable charges, and proportional sanctions. No moderator authority required. Every charge cites a definition anyone can audit. If any charge misapplies a definition, the case should be overturned.

### Economic Simulation
A model of trust-backed IOU currency under growth, testing whether a voluntary economy with prosecution services resists inflation and wealth concentration.

## Principles

1. **Logic is the supreme rule.** No authority, tradition, or majority overrides a valid logical argument.
2. **Passive Golden Rule.** Do not do unto others what you would not want done unto you. No victim, no crime.
3. **Voluntary interaction.** All legitimate exchange requires consent. Coercion invalidates agreement.
4. **Falsifiability.** Every definition, charge, and framework claim can be challenged and overturned if shown to be logically inconsistent. This is not a weakness — it is the mechanism that keeps the system honest.
5. **Proportionality.** Sanctions match the harm. No collective punishment. The purpose of punishment is restoration, not control.
6. **Error is not evil; refusing to correct it is.**

## Contributing

The framework is falsifiable by design. If you find a contradiction in the dictionary, a misapplied definition in a prosecution, or a flaw in the economic model — open an issue. That's how the system improves.

The test is simple: are we willing to update the framework if someone finds a genuine contradiction? The answer must always be yes.
