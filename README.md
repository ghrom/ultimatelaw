# Ultimate Law

**Logic as the supreme rule. Do no harm, or else.**

This repository contains the open-source tools and framework maintained by [ultimatelaw.org](https://ultimatelaw.org) — a charitable project dedicated to building coherent, falsifiable, voluntary governance.

## What's Here

### University
[Ultimate Law University](UNIVERSITY.md) — Education through falsification. Four programs: Constitutional Studies (the dictionary), Applied Ethics (prosecution framework), First Principles Knowledge (encyclopedia), Economic Theory (simulation). No tuition, no degrees — just falsifiable curriculum and the challenge to break it.

### Dictionary
The [Coherent Dictionary of Simple English](https://ultimatelaw.org/coherent-dictionary-of-simple-english/) — a normative dictionary that defines key terms (fraud, deception, coercion, crime, punishment, and more) within a consistent logical framework. Every definition avoids contradictions and aligns with core principles: logic as the top rule, the passive Golden Rule, free trade, no victim no crime, and voluntary interaction.

The dictionary is the constitutional foundation. Everything else builds on it.

**Two-tier structure:**

| File | Terms | Size | Purpose |
|------|-------|------|---------|
| [`coherent-dictionary-of-simple-english.txt`](dictionary/coherent-dictionary-of-simple-english.txt) | 170 | 40KB | Core constitutional definitions — ideal for tiny embedded models, quick reference, implementations |
| [`coherent-dictionary-extended.txt`](dictionary/coherent-dictionary-extended.txt) | 17,470 | 868KB | Full aligned corpus — every term verified/aligned with UL principles, suitable for comprehensive model training |

The extended dictionary was built by realigning WordNet 1.5 with Ultimate Law principles:
- Every governance term requires consent of the governed
- Every property term respects voluntary exchange
- Every crime term centers on victims, not statutes
- Neutral terms (science, medicine, objects) pass through unchanged

- **Core**: [`dictionary/coherent-dictionary-of-simple-english.txt`](dictionary/coherent-dictionary-of-simple-english.txt)
- **Extended**: [`dictionary/coherent-dictionary-extended.txt`](dictionary/coherent-dictionary-extended.txt)

### Prosecution Framework
A method for prosecuting fraud, spam, deception, and other harms on digital platforms using published definitions, falsifiable charges, and proportional sanctions. No moderator authority required. Every charge cites a definition anyone can audit. If any charge misapplies a definition, the case should be overturned.

- [`prosecution-framework/methodology.md`](prosecution-framework/methodology.md) — How to build a case
- [`prosecution-framework/cases/`](prosecution-framework/cases/) — Case archive (filed prosecutions)
- [`prosecution-framework/bluesky-labeler-research.md`](prosecution-framework/bluesky-labeler-research.md) — Cross-platform expansion via AT Protocol

### Encyclopedia Galactica
A complete curriculum for restarting civilization from first principles. 18 texts covering logic, physics, chemistry, biology, economics, history, survival, agriculture, materials, infrastructure, medicine, communication, navigation, and social organization.

~148,000 words of simple English procedures. A survivor with these texts can rebuild civilization from nothing.

- [`encyclopedia/`](encyclopedia/) — The full curriculum
- [`encyclopedia/README.md`](encyclopedia/README.md) — Reading order and volume structure

Designed for print publication as a four-volume set. Use it, adapt it, translate it, sell it. It's a gift to humanity.

### Economic Simulation
A model of trust-backed IOU currency under growth, testing whether a voluntary economy with prosecution services resists inflation and wealth concentration.

- [`simulation/economy-sim.py`](simulation/economy-sim.py) — Python simulation
- [`simulation/findings.md`](simulation/findings.md) — Results and design implications

## Principles

1. **Logic is the supreme rule.** No authority, tradition, or majority overrides a valid logical argument.
2. **Passive Golden Rule.** Do not do unto others what you would not want done unto you. No victim, no crime.
3. **Voluntary interaction.** All legitimate exchange requires consent. Coercion invalidates agreement.
4. **Falsifiability.** Every definition, charge, and framework claim can be challenged and overturned if shown to be logically inconsistent. This is not a weakness — it is the mechanism that keeps the system honest.
5. **Proportionality.** Sanctions match the harm. No collective punishment. The purpose of punishment is restoration, not control.
6. **Error is not evil; refusing to correct it is.**

## Contributing

The framework is falsifiable by design. If you find a contradiction in the dictionary, a misapplied definition in a prosecution, or a flaw in the economic model — open an issue. That's how the system improves.

The test is simple: are we willing to update the framework if someone finds a genuine contradiction? The answer must always be yes.
